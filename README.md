This MIT Digital Humanities Lab project is part of the [MIT/SHASS Programs in Digital Humanities](https://digitalhumanities.mit.edu/) funded by the [Mellon Foundation](https://www.mellon.org/).

This toolkit is an extension of work we began in Fall 2018 analyzing gender in English language novels.
The results of that research is available at [The Gender Novels Project](http://gendernovels.digitalhumanitesmit.org)
website, and our research code is available at the [Gender/Novels repo](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/).
