# Gender / Novels

## Analysis of Gender and Gender Relations in English-Language Novels, 1770-1922

This research project concerns the depiction of gender in historical English language novels, exploring how authors of various backgrounds and experiences described gender in their works.

Currently, we have analyzed a corpus of over 4,200 books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), an online book repository, utilizing programming methods we developed. Among our findings, we discovered the ratio of male pronouns to female pronouns, the most common words after male and female pronouns, and the distance between repetitions of male and female pronouns.

Our analysis and writeups are available at [The Gender Novels Project][http://gendernovels.digitalhumanitesmit.org] website.

## Navigating Gender / Novels

For anybody who wants to use our code, here’s a little outline of where everything is.
In the [`gender_novels/gender_novels`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/tree/master/gender_novels) folder, there are six folders: 

1. [`analysis`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/tree/master/gender_novels/analysis) — programming files focused on textual analysis and research write-ups, including data visualizations and conclusions
2. [`corpora`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/tree/master/gender_novels/corpora) — metadata information on each book (including author, title, publication year, etc.), including sample data sets and instructions for generating a [Gutenberg mirror](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/tree/master/gender_novels/corpora/gutenberg_mirror_sample)
3. [`pickle_data`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/tree/master/gender_novels/pickle_data) — pickled data for various analyses to avoid running time-consuming computation
4. [`testing`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/tree/master/gender_novels/testing) — files for code tests
5. [`tutorials`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/tree/master/gender_novels/tutorials) — tutorials used by the lab to learn about various technical subjects needed to complete this project

For a user who’ll need some readily available methods for analyzing documents, the files you’ll most likely want are [`corpus.py`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/master/gender_novels/corpus.py) and [`novel.py`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/master/gender_novels/novel.py). These include methods used for loading and analyzing texts from the corpora. If you’d like to generate your own corpus rather than use the one provided in the repo, you’ll want to use [`corpus_gen.py`](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/master/gender_novels/corpus_gen.py). If you’d only like a specific part of our corpus, the method `get_subcorpus()` may be useful.
