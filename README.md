This MIT Digital Humanities Lab project is part of the [MIT/SHASS Programs in Digital Humanities](https://digitalhumanities.mit.edu/) funded by the [Mellon Foundation](https://www.mellon.org/).

This toolkit is an extension of work we began in Fall 2018 analyzing gender in English language novels.
The results of that research is available at [The Gender Novels Project](http://gendernovels.digitalhumanitesmit.org)
website, and our research code is available at the [Gender/Novels repo](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/).

## Documentation
Complete documentation for the toolkit, including installation instructions and a user's guide,
is available at https://gender-analysis.readthedocs.io/

Please note that this project is not yet officially launched, and the instructions for installation via Pip do not yet work. See https://github.com/dhmit/gender_analysis/issues/94 if you'd like to be a very early adopter.
