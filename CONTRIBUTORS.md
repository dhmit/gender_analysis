# Gender Analysis Toolkit Contributors

The Gender Analysis Toolkit is developed and maintained by the MIT Digital Humanities lab.

The initial core of the Gender Analysis Toolkit was developed as part of the Gender/Novels project, Fall 2019.
Contributors to that original project can be found at [Gender/Novels contributors](https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
and on the [team page](http://gendernovels.digitalhumanitiesmit.org/info/team.html) on the [Gender / Novels website](http://gendernovels.digitalhumanitiesmit.org/info/gender_novels_overview).


In Summer 2019, the following [MIT UROP](http://uaap.mit.edu/research-exploration/urop) students worked to refactor
and polish this codebase into an accessible toolkit for the wider world.
