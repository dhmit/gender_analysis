    "In the Digital Humanities Lab, we're going to be ensuring that our code is thoroughly documented and tested. This is important because we are collaborating with others and we will also be sharing our code publicly. Once you get used to writing documentation, then tests, then code, you may find that writing the code comes more easily because you have already thought through what a function (for example) does and what the possible edge cases are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not being careful and thorough with testing can cause significant problems. Some historical examples of failure due to not testing correctly or not testing thoroughly include:\n",
    "* [Mars Probe Lost Due to Simple Math Error](http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/01/news/mn-17288)\n",
    "* [Why carmakers always insisted on male crash dummies](https://www.boston.com/cars/news-and-reviews/2012/08/22/why-carmakers-always-insisted-on-male-crash-test-dummies)\n",
    "* [Boeing 787 Dreamliners contain a potentially catastrophic software bug](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/boeing-787-dreamliners-contain-a-potentially-catastrophic-software-bug/)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the lab will not be developing probes, cars, or airplanes, it is still important to test code to ensure that it is useful to other developers and end users. We recommend writing the test prior to writing the code.\n",

    "## doctest\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes prepackaged with a test framework module called [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/doctest.html). This module searches for pieces of text within code comments that look like interactive Python sessions wihin code, then executes those sessions in order to confirm that that code runs exactly as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The doctest also generates documentation for our code. We'll go through an example of using doctest with a function we create called `count_vowels()`.\n",
    "\n",
