Isnâ€™t that such bullshit? Like why string out that line of hope for us when we knew weâ€™re not getting any more of the character. Its like theyâ€™re teasing us. 

*5 min left to the sequel trilogy* 

Oh yeah btw Finn is force sensitive. Bye forever!ðŸ‘‹ 

They should have just kept it out of the dialogue if they werenâ€™t going to flesh it out more. 

Poe and Finn (and nearly all of the other side characters) all just feel so tiny to Rey who just completely overpowers and stands above them all. Its a very weird balance. 

Even in the OT, Han and (untrained) Leia were great allies alongside Luke, and he ultimately would have been screwed without them. 

In the ST, its pretty clear Rey could just do whatever and lightning blast a bitch without the help of her supporting characters, making them insignificant.
