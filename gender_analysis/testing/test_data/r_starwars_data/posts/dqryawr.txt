Oh, my bad then.  Thanks for the tip.  

I dunno, when someone says something like that you just kind of feel... excluded?  Like, why is that extra manly?  I get that it's encouragement for men that it's okay to weep,  but usually by saying something is the special province of one gender, it kind of precludes the other.  So is it not supposed to be feminine or womanly to be passionate about things, then?  Isn't that just the human condition, especially of great people- artists, poets, inventors, creators- to be passionate?  

Forgive my rant, it honestly makes more sense if it's a quote rather than an original thought.  Reddit is always quoting, and I get most of them, I think, but can't keep up with every single thing in the world.
