My beef with Rian was that JJ set up a lot of stuff in TFA, but Rian was like, fuck that shit and did his own thing. So it kinda seemed like the whole first movie could have not happened and we would have been fine. It just seemed like the whole trilogy was disjointed and lacked a coherent narrative. JJ should have done all 3 movies.
