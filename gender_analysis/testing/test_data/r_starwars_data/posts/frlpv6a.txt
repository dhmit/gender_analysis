I would not be angry if, in 5-6 years, Disney says, “fuck it. The entire sequel trilogy is now non-canon. We are making a new one!”

The sad thing is, I like the actors. And of course Carrie Fisher has passed. And don’t get me wrong: I enjoy watching each movie separately, despite their flaws. But there’s no cohesiveness, not an overall plot line.
