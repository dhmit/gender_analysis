Agreed. 

This entire subplot would’ve been incredible as part of a live action series in the vein of Mandalorian. I would’ve loved to have seen the relationship between Rose and Finn grow over several episodes, and exploration of the dark side of war profiteering keeping the fight going, etc. and it would’ve provided ample time for Finn to develop his leadership, and maybe even lead other like minded stormtroopers to rebel against the FO.
