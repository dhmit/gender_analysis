Right, I was merely answering the question of "why didn't [George] think of this?" - he "didn't think of it" because he didn't want to go into the Yoda species. Even if Baby Yoda still is a mystery, he probably didn't even want to go down that road himself as he maybe initially thought it would put too much focus on the Yoda species.
