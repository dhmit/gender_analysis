my friend had a similar story about him, she was at some con or something and he had stayed behind to talk to every person that wanted to meet him, even taking pictures with them and stuff well after the actual event had ended and closed its doors. even random people just walking by he just stayed and talked to for ages, not getting paid or anything just hanging out with fans. 

honestly he would be my top celeb id like to meet, not even just because of star wars but because he just seems like such a nice, gentle person. 

also, he was arguably the best joker too lol. i didnt grow up with his era of star wars but i did grow up with that batman series and watched every episode. tbh i like star wars a shit ton more now days than i did when i was a kid.
