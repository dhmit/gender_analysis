I remember years ago when I was like 12ish, for Christmas I got the Star Destroyer set that was smaller than this but still pretty huge for a Lego set. I spent the next week during Christmas break coming in and building that things a few hours a day and then when I got bored, I'd go downstairs and play my brand new copy of The Force Unleashed on the Wii. That was a such a great game, and I still have my fully assembled Star Destroyer. Came with a Darth Vader, Tarkin, some Royal Guards, and a couple stormtroopers IIRC.
