Can we be real? This trilogy had alot of potential..... Alot of missed opportunity and miss direction. The trilogies didn't put any further attention to the Skywalkers. They didn't put any substance.
It was basically..... "Let's throw shit together throw it at the wall and see what sticks."
To the star wars fans..... I believe it didn't stick..... Nothing flowed. No character development.
And end scene.
