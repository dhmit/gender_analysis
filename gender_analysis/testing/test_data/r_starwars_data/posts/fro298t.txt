In Rian's own movie he doesnt even explore the consequences of the themes he himself sets up, why would anybody take it seriously? Finn is exactly the same person before and after Canto Bight. He doesnt have hesitation about shooting fellow child soldiers after being reminded of slavery. He doesnt have any qualms about dying for a resistance that was proven to at least be a little corrupt. He doesnt have any questions for Leia, nor does he mention any of this to the person most sympathetic to the message, Poe. Instead, the entire arc has zero impact on the story and all those themes are left to gather dust in the third act of the film.

So spare me. If you're a bad enough storyteller that you can't explore the themes you set up in your own film and need a sequel to act as a crutch, then you wrote a bad movie. Period. This is like saying "this series is garbage in the first season but the second makes up for it"
