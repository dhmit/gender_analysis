He did go to Yoda, and Yoda advocated for letting go of attachments(In the novelization Yoda suspected Anakin meant Obiwan).  The attachment  itself, the willingness to do anything to save her, was why he fell.  The Jedi didn't help much, but it was Anakins inability to let go that caused his turn, just like it was his inability to let go that caused his massacre of the tuskin raiders.
