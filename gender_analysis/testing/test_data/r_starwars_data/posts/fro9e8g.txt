He didnt even NEED to use a lightsaber!  Just have him use the force in different ways! New subplot: 
He gathers some resistance members and helps them.  The resistance could have been unique in the fact that so many were Force Sensitive and with Lea in charge, they would have been not just soldiers but force sensitive soldiers too.
