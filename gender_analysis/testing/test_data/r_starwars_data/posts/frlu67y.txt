These movies were all a huge let down, all 3 for profoundly different reasons. To me, the only redeeming qualities was Kylo Ren and they even dropped the ball with him. Rey ended up being the most uninteresting character despite the excellent performance by Ridley. 

Boyega was absolutely robbed of a great meaningful arc. Let's not even talk about Luke. 

Rogue One has its flaws but is the only one of the movies that "feels" like Star Wars. It's the only one anymore I put on a regular basis. 

The Mandalorian was a fantastic course correction but mark my words studio interference well ruin Kenobi due to executives getting nervous they won't be able to pull it off again rather than just trust Favreau and Filoni. 

Things don't look good for Star Wars in the movie front. Too many cooks in the kitchen. 

My only hope is Favreau and Filoni take over Lucasfilm sooner than later.
