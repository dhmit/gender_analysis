I mean, the originals were filmed on location, so ambiance was sort of provided by location selection. From there, practical effects were used to assist whenever necessary (which was a lot). The prequels rapid fire much more planets and locations much faster with a lot having to be made in studios and whatnot, and cgi being used for basically anything that wasn’t stationary. So, by technicality, I guess the prequels have more practical effects because it crams much more in much faster with a much larger budget and more crew members? But the mentality was definitely more practical and commendable for the originals, especially given the time and effort that had to go in to every idea’s execution at the time. Spaceships, sets, aliens, etc. was completely practical. The prequels CGI-d literally all of these things and then some, with practicality being the exception not the rule.
