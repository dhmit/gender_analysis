Finn was so hard done by as a character. After being given some decent development in TFA, he’s back at square one in TLJ, spends the movie on an ultimately pointless side plot where he basically plays second fiddle to Rose, he gets denied a hero’s death and then in TROS his whole character arc consists of shouting “REEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYY”. 

If I was John Boyega, I would be so pissed off about it. But saying that the sequels were a clusterfuck of just awful so he won’t be the only one.
