See, this is such a misinterpretation of what the Jedi were about. 

(Just so you know - because tone is hard in text - I am kinda passionate about this but I don't actually mean this as an attack on you, :). )

The Jedi were NOT anti-emotion. They were anti-ATTACHMENT.

The Jedi code... or chunks of it at least... were based on Buddhist philosophy. Buddhists and Jedi are allowed emotions. They just need to recognise them and not allow them to rule their actions. This was, in fact, one of Anakin's main faults. He made this interpretation mistake because he couldn't let go of attachment and so many viewers just went 'He's actually totally right. The Jedi got emotions wrong'. But this was Anakin trying to blame the Jedi for his own faults.

Anakin was not right. He misunderstood. Jedi are allowed emotion. The same way Buddhists are allowed emotion. Know any Buddhists? Unemotional is totally the wrong word. Cold and inhuman are also bad words to describe them :)

For example, 'Jedi are encouraged to love'. Totally true, Anakin. That's a quote from Anakin. He knew that, but chose to misinterpret for his own reasons. Yes, love. But not 'cling so hard to the life of your loved one that you commit mass child murder'. Just 'love'. Pretty sure love is an emotion. And something Jedi actually were encouraged to do. Just not to form desperate attachments around.

The problem Anakin had was he was attached to impermanent things. Buddhists - and apparently Jedi - see attachment to stuff that's going to fade (ie, everything and anything) as causing pain and unecessary suffering. And confusion. 

Yoda basically gives Anakin a whole lecture on this. 

Anakin, in fact was attached to keeping everyone that he loved safe forever and never dying. Anakin feared death itself, even though death is natural. And it was because of his over-attachment that he gave in to that fear. He was allowed to love his Mom. But not be so attached that he commits a bit of ethnic cleansing and child murder when she dies... No. Not so much. That's why he was told not to go to her. His attachment was dangerous. And Yoda knew it. Jedi are allowed to love and feel compassion. To save others. Are encouraged to. But not to have that love make it so you can't recognise and accept that all things pass, even those we love.

Hell, the reason he turns is his attachment to the life of Padme. He cannot accept impermanence. People he loves WILL die. That's a fact of life that he refuses to accept. The moment he turns to the Dark Side in the prequels is literally the point where the Plagueis speech happens. He's offered a way to keep his attachments! To save people from death! From impermanence! That's when he is lost.

It's not his emotions. And no Jedi said it was. It was his attachments. Not his love... his fear of *losing* what he loves! There's an important distinction there.

Jedi are allowed emotion. They're even encouraged towards positive emotions. As George said, Jedi aren't even necessary celibate. They're allowed sex and encouraged in compassion and love and kindness and even righteous anger. They have to CONTROL their emotions. And that's not a bad thing.

This whole 'Grey Jedi' shit I keep hearing about is a total misinterpretation of what seems to have been the original intent and comes from people thinking Anakin, of all people, understood the problems of the Jedi. The Jedi were ALREADY 'grey' Jedi. They balanced their emotions. They stepped back from attachment where it could cause them grief and loss of neutrality. They strove towards positive emotions where those could help them and the people around them.

It seems to be a problem at us Westerners missing the basic Eastern Philosophy that George kinda shoehorned into his cool space-battle movies.

Some of Anakin's last words in the movie even relate to impermanence and death. 'But you'll die' says Luke. 'Nothing can stop that now,' says Anakin... who literally turned evil to stop death. When he gives up his fight against impermanence, THAT'S the sign he's finally realised his faults. Not emotion. He loves Luke. He was compassionate towards the whole galaxy when he fought the emporer. But he's finally willing to give in to impermanence - his own - and that's why he was strong enough to defeat the Emperor. Not denying emotion. Denying attachment. Accepting impermanence. Accepting death.

Anakin's entire six movie arc isn't 'kid is messed up by emotionless Jedi, turns evil, then turns good'. It's 'Kid fails to accept impermanence despite the best help of the emotion-understanding Jedi, turns evil to fight that impermanence because of his attachments, finally realises that he can't fight that and still love his children the right way. Gives up that fight and turns good. Saves galaxy now that he finally realises he was wrong.'


I know there's stuff in the extended universes that makes this argument less strong, but just from the movies I think this is a more accurate representation of the Jedi and their motivations, knowing that George was basing a lot of their philosophy off of Buddhist thought.

tl;dr: Jedi are like Buddhists and did too like emotions! They didn't like ATTACHMENT. And I can prove it!
