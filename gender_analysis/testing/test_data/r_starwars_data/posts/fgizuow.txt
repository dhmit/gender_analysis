The exact opposite, actually. When Disney acquired Star Wars, everything except the 6 main films and The Clone Wars series was declared noncanon. KOTOR was a casualty of this decision. That's what the "Legends" tag means by the way. It's for things from the old canon structure, whether they were canon then or not.
