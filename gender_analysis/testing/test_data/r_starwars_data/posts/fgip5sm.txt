I mean, the article is not wrong about this setup, it's a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the clues given by the canon material.  
I don't remember if the novelizations of the OT mentioned them, but if I'm correct the Star Wars d6 RPG from WEG might have been the first to mention datapads, the SW equivalent of our tablets.
