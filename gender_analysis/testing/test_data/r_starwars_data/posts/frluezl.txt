Also I'd wish Ray would have became a Sith and Ben Solo a true "neutral". It would have been such a big plot twist and it fitted perfectly into the story until the third film...

The force would be at a true balance with one Jedi(Finn), one Sith(Ray) and a neutral one(Ben) who can mediate for whenever one side grows stronger than the other.
