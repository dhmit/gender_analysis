people say this all the time and its such a dumb argument

of course they had *more* in pure numbers. They were larger projects than the OT.

 It's disingenuous to think however that the prequels didn't completely overdo the cgi and greenscreen. What does it matter that they created hundreds of beautfiul miniature sets when the final product is crappy and they look out of place because the actors have been green screened into them?
