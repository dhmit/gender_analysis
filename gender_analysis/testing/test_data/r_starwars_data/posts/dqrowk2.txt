Yeah, it's not really "good or evil". It's more like 2 different ideologies tbh (kinda like USA vs USSR in the cold war). Both sides view their side as right, with the Jedi following the teachings of self sacrifice, acceptance, inner peace etc. while the Sith follow teachings of following your desires, emotions, power desire etc. It's because of this that more Sith tend to be evil than Jedi I guess.
