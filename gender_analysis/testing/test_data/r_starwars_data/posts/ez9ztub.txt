A long time ago in like 2014 or something they limited the amount of downvotes that can go to your actual karma because there was a trend of heavy shitposting to try to get as much negative karma as possible.  
It got pretty bad at times and really would ruin the quality of subs so they changed it to be that you canâ€™t get unlimited negative karma one your score.
