This. 

When I saw Force Awakens I was really optimistic for the new movies. I thought it was a really enjoyable intro to the trilogy and was excited to see where it would all lead.

The next two movies felt like they were written by about 10 different people, spliced together to form nonsensical plots that were trying to be so many different themes all at once.
