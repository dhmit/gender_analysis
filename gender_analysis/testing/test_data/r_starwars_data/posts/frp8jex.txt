A consistent sequel? Take a look at ESB. That's a consistent sequel. The fact you say the Jedi screwed up Luke’s family....what the hell are you even referring to? Anakin turned to the dark side in an effort to save Padme. Luke tried to murder a kid in his sleep. Those are not Jedi things. The fact that you say ”JJ railroaded us back to his original plot”. Have you ever read anything about this? Like that it was Kennedy who decided Palpatine should returned before they had even rehired JJ. TLJ sent disney in a tailspend. Here’s how:

-[The Last Jedi](https://i.postimg.cc/8c7j5X52/9-DC451-A3-5-C0-B-435-A-A663-9-A275-C130009.jpg) made $730 million dollars less than [The Force Awakens](https://i.postimg.cc/TwYy83XY/63-F586-A5-42-E1-4-AC2-8075-EFF57873-B725.jpg)

-The Last Jedi has the lowest ratings of any Star Wars film (43%), while both JJ’s films have a (86%).

-The film after TLJ (Solo) lost $100 million dollars

The point is before you go pointing fingers at JJ, it’s important to realize that the studio didn’t not want a repeat of The Last Jedi. They don’t want fans divided. They want everyone they can buying tickets, toys, their billion dollar addition to Disneyland, etc. You remember Johnson being signed to do a trilogy? How comes it keeps getting pushed back? It’s not on the slate at all, and Disney keeps hiring new directors. They’ve had Johnson signed since 2017. Why no work on this? It’s easy. They don’t  want a repeat of TLJ. 

TLJ has massive plot holes, tries to re-write history, has Deus Ex Machina’s everywhere, subplots that’s go nowhere, etc. it’s got all kinds of problems to it.
