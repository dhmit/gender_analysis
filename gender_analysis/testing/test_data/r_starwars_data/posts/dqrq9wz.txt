Descriptions of grok in Stranger in a Strange Land - Grok /ˈɡrɒk/ is a word coined by American writer Robert A. Heinlein for his 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land. ... The concept of grok garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication.

Heinlein would have made a terrifying political figure. Every book he wrote was a sort of treatise on a very specific almost Rand style exposition on human affairs. Thank god he believed in being as lazy as possible.
