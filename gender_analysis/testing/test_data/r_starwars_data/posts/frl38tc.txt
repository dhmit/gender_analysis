While I like Rey, I do think having Finn be the Jedi would’ve been cooler. 

Imagine, a former stormtrooper who served under Kylo Ren, runs away from everything to end up with Luke Skywalker. The opposite of who he served. And think of how it would be for Kylo. The guy he has to fight was under his control and he couldn’t sense that he was force sensitive.
