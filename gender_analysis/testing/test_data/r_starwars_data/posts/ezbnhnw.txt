Doesn't sound like many days considering they didn't know about their dad. As for the tickets,I assume they took the girls with them to get some fresh air and see Disneyland. A change of scenery it's important, especially for a kiddo in a hospital.

As for the tour, what do you think it's the best way to alleviate pain ? Do you think it's good for the girls to linger on their emotions and traumatic memories ?
