> TLJ made Finn realize that good and evil isnt always as simple as Jedi vs Sith or rebels vs Empire.

Did it really? It never felt to me like Finn really needed to learn *this* lesson, yet TLJ made that his character arc for some reason. His character growth should have been in adjusting to normal non-militarized life and undoing the brainwashing of the First Order. 

Here's what I don't understand. You admit that his character was weak in TLJ, yet you're also defending his character beats as "solid"? This doesn't make sense to me. How can Finn have a weak character that's also good?
