Space fantasy vs western, typical chosen one hero's journey vs a story about prejudice and parenthood, completely different tones, different pacing and approaches resulting from theatrical vs serial production.

They really don't have much in common besides a shared setting. Proximity to the OT is hardly a mark of quality, just look at how the Christmas special turned out.
