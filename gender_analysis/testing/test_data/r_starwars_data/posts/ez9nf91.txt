This is more than I expected of them tbh. The Old Republic is the extent of my relationship with EA Star Wars at this point, and even that is a distant one. Still, that game has been going, what, eight years now? Nine? Free to play and is about to launch its third or fourth major expansion pack? Pretty neat.
