I didn't know any of the courses, was doing that stall thing when you hold down gas on start amongst other wrong things and still swear my controller wasn't calibrated properly (felt like it was pulling to the right.) I've only ever played it a few times. But a drunk challenge is a drunk challenge and I will not go softly into that dark night or something..
