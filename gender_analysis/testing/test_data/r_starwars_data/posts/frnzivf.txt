One of the first things to turn me off to the sequels was their treatment of Finn. I liked him and Rey as characters but then Finn started getting like anti character development with seemingly random and pointless things happening to him. They even shunted his romantic interest in Rey. And then Rey has all this vague and arbitrary character development. Her parents are such a weak and poorly developed plot point, and she just learns the force with like no training. Shit movies
