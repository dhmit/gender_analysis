Before the prequels finished I assumed the story would be that Sidious takes out Padme and frames the Jedi. Why else would Anakin straight up 180 on the Jedi? Oh, it’s actually cuz he dreams Padme might die and Sidious says “I dunno, maybe we could figure out how to have her not die or something”; guess it’s time to kill all the younglings. Then Padme dies from the Big Sad. 

Finn is definitely a wasted opportunity akin to Padme like you describe. Even seeing how excited John Boyega was when Finn grabbed the lightsaber in the trailer of Force Awakens makes me feel regret because you know that the actor wanted something more grand for the character as well.
