I agree. Learning from the past mistakes and moving on is one of the themes of the movie, after all. However, I take offence to the entire movie being called the "let the past die" film, and specifically, people blaming Rian J for using the line as his entire directorial vision and "killing" all star wars lore established beforehand, because he "wanted to kill star wars and literally put that line in the movie because that's what he wanted". Let the past dieâ‰ The Last Jedi. Learning from failures with the hope of a better tomorrow is what the entire movie was about, with Failure being the central theme. Yoda, one of the oldest known characters in the canon comes in as a ghost halfway through the movie and explains the entire theme to the audience. I don't know how they could've been more obvious without stopping the show and bringing out the chalkboard to explain it. I agree with you, but I am just tired of people using this line as an argument to shit on a movie.
