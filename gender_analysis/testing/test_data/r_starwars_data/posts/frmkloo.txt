>Did... did they not go to the casino planet in TLJ?

Which did nothing to further Finn's arc or add any substantive development for his character. 

>Did they not learn about the double-dealing of the arms dealers?

Which provided nothing in relation to Finn's development outside what he already said in TFA that he wanted to stay out of the clash between the Order and the Resistance.

>How are you saying that TLJ didn't do one of the things people whine about TLJ doing the most?

Specifically to Finn, the entire plot was meandering and did nothing to actually develop a moral conundrum or struggles for Finn until the 10 minutes of the film when he's captured and then faces Phasma. TLJ did the least in retrospect for Finn's arc. To say otherwise is completely disingenuous.
