Agree, but like many have reacted in my comment, why not have two protagonists? The prequels has two as well in Obi-Wan and Anakin. And while I know that Anakin is the real protagonist, I do think having Finn and Rey both be Jedi wouldâ€™ve been cool. Or why not make Rey still the lead of this movie but not make her force sensitive and make the Jedi for a change not the lead. Or give Rey the arc of Finn instead
