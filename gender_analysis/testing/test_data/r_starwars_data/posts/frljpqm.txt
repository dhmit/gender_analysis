I feel like Disney cant have a minority without forgetting about them or forcing them into a stereotype. Like they messed up Poes backstory to make him, the only Latinx character, a spice runner. They basically threw Rose in there for her to become irrelevant. Finn was just forgotten. And even with so many people working on the film, especially the actors, wanting Poe and Finn to be a couple, Disney said no.
