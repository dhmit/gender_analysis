You guys are missing out on all kinds of Star Wars backstory. The radio serialization has tons of moments missing from the movies. I'm only on "A New Hope" to where Luke & Ben are on the Falcon heading for Alderaan, and there is SOOOOOO much that's been filled in.  Scenes like Luke's friends, Leia & her father on Alderaan, C3P0 & R2D2 in the droid pool, Vader's torture of Leia, and tons of little bits that just make the world so much greater. It's mandatory for any SW fan.    EDIT PS. Mark Hamil & Anthony Daniels are in this one.
