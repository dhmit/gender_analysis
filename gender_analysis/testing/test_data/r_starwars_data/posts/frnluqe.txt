Leading up to The Last Jedi there were rumors that he, too, would be a Jedi - just without the Force. Like, he'd go on to study the Jedi way and learn to fight with a lightsaber even though he's not Force-sensitive. It wouldn't surprise me if that was JJ's plan for him (given all the teasing in TFA) before Rian Johnson went "Lol no he a coward now".
