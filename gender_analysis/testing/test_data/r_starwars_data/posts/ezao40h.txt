In a multiplayer FPS game, having to unlock a hero makes almost no sense, especially when all the heros were default unlocked in the previous Battlefronts. If it was some type of RPG, then yeah, as you progress through the story you get more weapons, armor, abilities, etc. Anytime a multiplayer FPS game tries to insert RPG elements though, the overwhelming majority of the time it benefits the monetization, not the actual gameplay.   

It was a fairly transparent attempt to use the mobile game business strategy that EA calls "player engagement". Simply put, they want to motivate you to play the game as long as possible every day, so that you'll be tempted to buy whatever microtransactions they're pushing. Or, at the very least you'll be there to keep the servers populated, so that the "whales" who do spend money on the microtransactions always have someone to play against.
