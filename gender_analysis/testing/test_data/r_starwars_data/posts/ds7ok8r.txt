That's true, but all of those series either give a reason for why it doesn't work, or they just never do it and we can reasonably assume that there's a reason.

Star Wars fell into the latter category until TLJ, and now we can't just assume it can't be done, because it clearly can. There have been tons of battle in Star Wars that would be totally different if that kind of destructive power was easily available (and it is, hyperdrives are everywhere in SW), so I don't see why it's unreasonable to ask why it's never been a thing until now.
