Imagine, Finn clearly shows force sensitivity in Ep 9.

Let's dial that progression partly into Ep 8, have it hinted at along the film. He finds ex stormtroopers in Ep 8 but fails to rally them or get them to join the cause. The stormtroopers are scared as shit of the First Order like Finn was in Ep 7. 

Him and Rose go around this side of the story instead of Kanto Blight and her weird "We save people" nonsense is like a "Fuck the stormtrooper exiles and their fears, likes be heroes."

He still ends up on the ship at the end, he still ends the film being defeated since the films narrative is about accepting defeat and getting back up again.

But in Ep 9 hes on the verge of becoming a real force user. He finds a way to convince the others to join the war effort and they show up at the final battle when the whole Galaxy comes to save the day against the Final Order.

The his story ends with Rey agreeing to train him to become a Jedi.
