He became a General & Co-lead the Rebellion, he also led the ground team that destroyed the Final Order’s fleet.  How is that not playing a big role???  He also tried to save the Rebellion in episode 8 putting himself in harms way twice, once by boarding Snope’s ship in disguise & once again by trying to take down the mini-cannon.
