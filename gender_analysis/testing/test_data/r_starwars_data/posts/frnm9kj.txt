Aside from Han, Chewie, Luke, and Kylo Ren, I didn't really care about anyone in the entire sequel trilogy. To me, they were all just too shallow and their personalities varied too much from film to film.

Finn went from ex-stormtrooper force sensitive to comic relief.

Poe went from cool pilot guy to unlikable general guy to asshole Han Solo rip off guy.

Rey went from female Luke, to 'oh i know all the force stuff now' to fake Skywalker.

And... Leia should have passed offscreen after Ep. 7, but that's just my 2 cents.

Call me old, but I'll just go back to my beloved classic Star Wars now... but I'm bringing Rogue One, Solo, and the Mandalorian with me!
