Right? I watched it just tonight and thought, yeah, they phoned it in a bit with a shiny New Hope rehash, but the opening back-and-forth with Kylo and Lor San Tekka was pretty electric ("you've gotten old" "something much worse has happened to you") and I was thinking why wasn't this character explored more? He clearly had history with him, he was aware of either Luke or Leia, I'd have liked to find out, maybe through some Luke exposition, how he tied in with things in layer films. But no, he just got tossed in the trash, apparently with any ideas of a continuous narrative, like so many other dead ends, and I found it a fitting comparison to the trilogy as a whole. Maybe it got covered in a comic series, like Luke's fight with the Knights of Ren or Kylo's crossguard saber explanation, but it would have been real nice to see it happen or heard it explained on screen, not read about it on Comic ComicVine or some shit.
