I personally **love** the sequel trilogy, however, I am fully aware of the flaws and missed potential that it holds. 

What would have been nice is after TFA (perfect set up) Rey was the focus like she was, but you know, still let Finn play with lightsabers. That's all I wanted. Have two buddy Lightsaber users trying to figure their shit out together/separate. 

If anything, I have mixed feelings about TLJ. The biggest flaw is that it's literally right after TFA. There should have been some kind of time jump and with some flashbacks with Rey and Luke's initial interactions. Also, they don't really capitalize on the fact that there is a MASSIVE universe around them. They keep 90% of the movie within one space. It felt like a fishbowl in an ocean. They trapped themselves in a small space with not much room to grow.

Still like it and enjoy the movie, but it's no where near perfect. 

RoS, I feel, did the best that it could with what was given to it. Again, a lot of potential was missed. 
- Utilizing Finn's sensitivity. 
- Would have been nice to see Benicio del Toro again. 
- I don't care about Rose, but they should have given her a little more attention. 
- Palpatine should have said Unlimited Power
- Anakin should have talked to Ben (love you Harrison)
- I feel Ben should have been there at the final blow (still could have done his resurrection thing. Though, the whole old jedi voices was awesome)
- Anakin should have been there at the end because you know *Skywalker*.


At the end, I personally do not think any of the series are perfect. Some are better than others (you know which ones), but it's all still one hell of an adventures. I am excited for what the SWU holds.
