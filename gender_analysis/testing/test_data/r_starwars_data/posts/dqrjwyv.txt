Seriously. Anyone who says otherwise simply hasn’t gone into the EU enough. Sith Lords literally consuming the Force energy of entire star systems to fuel their prolonged life and force abilities and mastery. 

Sith Lords murdering children to absorb their Force energy to heal themselves or to power up. 

Sith Lords murdering their parents or their in laws, attempting to murder their sisters and killing their cousins to gain prestige and military power and subvert the chosen government of trillions of beings in the galaxy because they think they know better, all in the name “order.”

The Sith are unequivocally evil. 

The Jedi are more like incredibly overly strict parents who are trying to guide a child in the way they think they should go, and making several shitty decisions along the way because their belief system is fundamentally flawed. They still want to help everyone, provide equal footing for everyone and keep the innocent from harm.
