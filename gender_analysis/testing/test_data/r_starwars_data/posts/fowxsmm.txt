It's actually how my love for Lego started. I was adopted when I was 18 months old and a doctor told my parents that adopted children have higher chances of developing ADHD. He said that puzzles are a good way to counter that. My mom made me do a lot of puzzles when I was very young. I do have attention disorder but puzzles and Lego are one of the many things I can and really be a focus on.
