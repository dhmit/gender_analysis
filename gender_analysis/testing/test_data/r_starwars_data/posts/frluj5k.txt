I really do wish we got to see Finn as a Jedi in training. His force sensitivity in Episode IX seemed... forced. I would have LOVED to have seen Luke training 2 Jedi in Episode XIII. One (Rey) who is a natural talent, but leans towards the dark side; and the other (Finn) who has to work harder to harness his power. Ending of XIII could have been her siding the Kylo and turning tot he dark side, and in IX they get her back. Bam. Fuckin' sign and book me, KK. 

But, seriously, so much wasted potential :(
