I actually disagree with the “you don’t promote” mentality. That was 100% a genius move, as it set up a surprise for that movie that no one was expecting but maybe the hardcores. Using Finn in the promotional material and the trailers was a great way to swerve the audience and hide the really Jedi. She was using a staff her whole life as well, it does help make the jump for her being good with a weapon. It seems to make sense IMO.

I will say though they should’ve both been. I really think it would’ve been a poetic send off if Luke had restarted the school and had them both training, but that’s just me fantasy writing.
