Firstly, Jedi Consular isn’t really a rank, more of a job description for a particular type of Jedi (negotiators or researchers) in the clone wars.

Secondly, lightsaber colours were only used to indicate Jedi type (consular, guardian, sentinel) in the old republic era and had phased out by the time of the films (in fact colour matching type of Jedi is entirely non-canon, for better or worse).

In universe, by your statement, Ahsoka Tano would have a higher rank than Anakin, even though he was her master.

I appreciate that you were just joking, but you got enough upvotes for visibility and I didn’t want people to be confused or misled lol
