They got older. 

Post ROTJ I think all the actors were trying to move on from their roles and didn't want to be type cast. Guys like Hamill and Ford were known to be openly hostile to people approaching them to talk about Star Wars. There were no "Star Wars" conferences or panels with them, and they didn't want to talk about the movies on talk shows.

As they got older they mellowed out, but I distinctly remember a Kevin Smith interview (or a monologue) where he talked about his fears with regards to approaching Mark Hamill for his role in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Smith was genuinely surprised that Hamill was okay with playing Cock Knocker and the various jedi references. That was early 2000s, so I guess that would be when he started becoming more accepting of his Star Wars legacy.

My point though is that Hamill hasn't always been this much of a "gift" to the fans. He matured into it.
