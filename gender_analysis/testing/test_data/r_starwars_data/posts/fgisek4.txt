Right? There truly is NO winning ever with these nerds. People bleat about how good the Mandalorian is and say "Why couldn't the movies be good like this?" Well, because the Mandalorian's main stars were never in the movies â€“ so of course fans gave it a chance and enjoyed it. Same goes for Rogue One. 

Any movies that had Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie in them were doomed from the start, because it was clear that fans will never accept *any* sort of change or new storyline with them. Solo is a pretty good example of that too! It's a damn shame, really.

I wish Star Wars fans were more like Marvel fans. Marvel fans are pretty good about going with the flow and accepting tonal changes. They're not perfect, as a fandom, but they tend to be a lot more open-minded and ready to embrace change than SW fans are. Those are good qualities to have, as fans.
