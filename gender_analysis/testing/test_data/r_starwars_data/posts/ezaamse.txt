The funny thing is the guy who said that was already banned from Reddit. He wasnâ€™t allowed to have any personal accounts on the platform due to allegedly trying to bribe the Star Wars Battlefront subreddit moderators. He was banned following that incident, and then a couple years later he posts that comment through the official EA account and gets the most downvoted comment in Reddit history LMAO
