I totally agree. Me as someone who has never gotten into starwars was quite hyped to watch the first movie. Which wasn't too bad. And as I was watching the third one (where I fell asleep half way through) I had to remind myself why he was even in this trilogy. He has so much potential. Really doesn't help that I was not sold on Rey and her terrible acting.
