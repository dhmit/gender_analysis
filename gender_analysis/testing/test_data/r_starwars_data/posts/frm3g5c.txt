The bar wasn't even high; all they had to do was be better than the prequels and people would've been happy. And they got halfway there just by having decent dialogue/writing. All they needed was a cohesive story and they'd have been set.  Yet somehow they just... didn't write a story and fucked it all up. There are probably thousands of reddit comments from the weeks after TFA outlining possible story arcs for the trilogy and pretty much any one of them would have done the job just because they were written by one person and had *some* direction.
