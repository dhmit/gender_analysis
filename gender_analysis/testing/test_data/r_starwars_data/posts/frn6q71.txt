Finn needs graphic novels or textual novels, or a miniseries, or something. All of those new characters were robbed. The storytelling was unfocused and bloated, kept introducing new characters to do narrative lifting and it just felt like the main characters were passive observers in their own story.

Like, a role playing session where the players are new and donâ€™t know how to self start, so the GM constantly adds NPCs to get the players to start role playing, or at least attempting basic skill checking to advance the plot.

The actors were not at fault here, it felt like it was somewhere between the whiteboard and the script.
