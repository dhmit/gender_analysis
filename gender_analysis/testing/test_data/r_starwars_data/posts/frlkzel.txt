Except neither Finn nor Rose do anything with the information they obtain in the casino planet. Yeah, they're taught that war sucks and there are no good guys... and then the regularly scheduled program resumes and they go right back to shooting stormtroopers and hanging out with Leia. They never bring up the futility of war, never confront the leadership about the arms dealers, never stop to think about anything. 

Would have been cool if that casino story had set up a plot thread that reveals that the arms dealers kept supplying the First Order so that war wouldn't stop and they wouldnt stop making profits, and that this is the reason why the FO randomly pops up out of nowhere and becomes so powerful. But this wasnt explored at all. Could have been awesome to have Finn realize that not only is the First Order evil, the New Republic was weak and unable to end corruption right under their noses. Could have been the beginning of something new. 

But instead we got shit. So spare me that "solid character beats" talk, TLJ was absolute garbage and I will die on this hill.
