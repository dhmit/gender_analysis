yeah i was 13, and empire is my favorite movie, but i thought all of the prequels were shit and refused to rewatch any of them until maybe 2010 just out of blind hate.  i think the prequels and the sequels are essentially the same, overall decent movies with a bunch of facepalming and cringe with some super fucking amazing parts sprinkled in with them.
