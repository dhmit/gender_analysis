But the Knives Out sequel shouldn’t factor in to anything. He was signed way before the first Knives Out Movie was made. Why is Johnson’s trilogy continuously pushed back? When D&D were hired, they got to go first, which means Johnson’s trilogy would be pushed to around or after 2026. D&D get fired. Johnson’s trilogy is not pushed up. It’s not even on the slate. If they are doing single movies now, why is he not given one of them? All these other directors are being courted, yet the guy they already have signed is not even doing Star Wars film. Rian at first was “Yeah, it’s going to happen” to “I'm still talking to Lucasfilm but they haven't announced anything on their slate yet." (They have since this interview) and “The truth is they're still figuring out their schedule, their game plan. If it's possible for me to squeeze in another film before or while working on that, I will”. Seeing him make another Star Wars film is doubtful.
