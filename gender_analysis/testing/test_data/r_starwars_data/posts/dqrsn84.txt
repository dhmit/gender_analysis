Getting pretty no-true-scotsmen on the sith here.  

Sure, they've got some propaganda and some pretty words about their code.

But in practice they're just evil.  All of them.  They're about passion, and freedom.  Sometimes, sort of.

But only their freedom.  Fuck everybody else's freedom.  Peace is a lie.  Etc.  

Being pro-my-freedom and anti-your-freedom is evil.  It isn't even necessarily chaotic in the slightest, if it's coupled with "and my freedom will be expressed by a galaxy spanning empire".

There are chaotic sith, but there are a lot more lawful sith.  you know what they have in common?  They're evil.
