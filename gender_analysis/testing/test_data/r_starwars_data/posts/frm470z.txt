Imagine how upset people would be if he just suddenly became a jedi in the third movie and became more relevant through that.. We got upset how easily rey became the "more important" without a lot of training compared to anakin, then suddenly a one movie wonder comes along like finn did and became as much of force to be reckoned with? That would piss people off way more. This could only be impossible with collaboration between all 3 directors between films (a consistent development for finn to be a powerful force sensitive person)
