I'm not upset he didn't become a Jedi. I thought that was an actually fairly reasonable attempt at subversion. 

Not a good one, cause the moment Rey was introduced it became kinda obvious the direction they are gonna go, but it was an interesting start of an attempt.

Plus it's Star Wars, so fine. The plucky scavenger from the desert planet gets the lightsaber.

But holy goddamn fuck did they waste his character. Poe's too, but Finn... Shit, they did him dirty in a bad way.
