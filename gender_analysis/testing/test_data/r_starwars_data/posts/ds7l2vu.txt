The Raddus barely clipped the wing of the Supremacy. 

I doubt it'd have damaged the Death Star at all. Just blown a ship-sized hole clean through it (which is a minor amount of damage for a moon-sized space station) and if it didn't luckily hit the reactor core, the Death Star wouldn't blow up at all.
