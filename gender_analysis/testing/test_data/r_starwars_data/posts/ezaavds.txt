Being purchasable ingame doesn't change what it is. By definition it's still a loot box granting content by chance to players. The only way to get that in-game currency is a long grind in game that's also tied to a terribly thought out leveling system. 

Which is terribly thought out because it was thrown together haphazardly after the outrage at launch.
