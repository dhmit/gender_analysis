> Rebels - Neutral Good (none) ... I see little evidence for the rebels being chaotic at all. Just because they're fighting against a lawful force does not mean that they are not lawful themselves.

The law doesnt mean morally good. The rebels are literally fighting against the established law, that makes them unlawful. They are still the good guys and the law in this case is an evil law but they are being unlawful in fighting it.
