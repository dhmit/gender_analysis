They also made stormtroopers kidnapped children and never adressed the morality of killing people with extreme stockholm syndrome. "Haha stormtrooper crashed into rock, nice one!" even finn while escaping in the first movie basically slaughtered stormtroopers he just broke away from without a thought. 

And knowing they are conditioned has never tried to reason with a single stormtrooper, did he know no one? Did he never speak to anyone ever? Not one single friend who he's like "hey i wonder if frank wants to blow this joint?" Imagine if while turning finn goes to his friend tries to convince him to leave and he fails. And finns antagonist isnt a chrome dome but his friend who is furious at him for turning his back on the empire.

 After all the empire brings order, ends slavery or what have you (insert dramatic empire ended slavery and my family is now free-ish but better than a slave while the republic unwilling to fight or expand their republic left the slavery unchecked in regions they didnt preside over) and finn has to come to terms with not only turning against the empire but his friend, who he went through basic with, who had his back against assholes and chromedomes. Imagine if finn wasnt a sanitary worker but had actually served in combat and built comraderie. As opposed to a character that seems to have sprung into existence and had nothing to do with a single person in the empire ever ahhhg.

Rant over, sorry think i had a seizure there. What happened?
