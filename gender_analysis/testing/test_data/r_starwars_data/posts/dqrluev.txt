Cute comment, but had to down vote.  Sorry, just a rule.  No irrelevant explanations.

But seriously, no one cares about your one insignificant downvote, and your comment is just even more of a downer.  Just want you to know how it comes across so you can continue doing it if you enjoy being a pedantic killjoy, or stop if you don't want people to think that way about you.
