I think this ignores the theme of the recent 3 movies. The concept that there’s no need for Jedi and Sith, just the force and people utilising it. 

I think the last 2 especially drove that point home and the concept of Finn using a lightsaber is a tool they used to drive that in. He’s force susceptible yeah and he’s handled a lightsaber a few times because his destiny and the force worked in tandem to produce that effect. That’s how I interpret it anyway.

Admittedly they did miss out on a lot of opportunity with Finn but I believe there’s more Finn and Rey to come personally.
