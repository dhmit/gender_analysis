It was hardly a grind, even before they updated it they threw so many credits in your face it was insane. The only way I could see someone spending any money on it past the sticker price is if they needed to have literally every star card unlocked and leveled up and didn't want to actually play the game to earn credits.

The challenges were stupid easy like 'get 10 headshots' or 'get 25 kills'.
