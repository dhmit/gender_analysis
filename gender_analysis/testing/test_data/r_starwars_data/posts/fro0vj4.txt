What concepts? Explain to me a single concept that was explored in a meaningful way in TLJ. Slavery? No child slaves were freed, just horses. Neutrality? Finn and Rose literally go right back to the same thing. Corruption? Nobody confronts Leia about the arms dealers. Fighting for what you love? Finn was about to do just that, but I guess tboning him in front of a firing squad of walkers and risking death is better. 

Finn learns absolutely nothing in this story. His arc doesn't just not change, it doesn't exist. He had his growth in TFA and then we're left with pretty much the same character in the end of TLJ. He was willing to spark up a lightsaber and duel his former boss on Starkiller but now Rian Johnson wants to to believe he's a coward that wants to escape? This is the equivalent of a random stormtrooper going up against Vader so Luke and the gang can escape in the Falcon. You don't regress to a coward after that.

So of course I'll blame the movie, dude. All it does it slap a couple concepts and themes around but doesn't even have the decency to respect and explore them. It thinks that because it showed a TIE and an Xwing coming from the same company, it's a deep moral treatise and it's not.
