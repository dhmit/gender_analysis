Politics has always been a major player in Star Wars. I mean, the Empire is literally a symbolic representation of fascism and Nazi Germany.

Stormtrooper is a German Army soldier from WW1 where Germany was also the aggressor/bad guys.

Having a political piece wasn't the problem, the problem is that it was executed so poorly.
