Finn and Poe should've been cast swapped. It made zero sense that thete would be a black stormtrooper considering the source of them. The casting of Finn was done purely for shock value when the TFA trailer first released.

Oscar Issac would've played the role of Finn much better while also, you know, LOOKING LIKE A STORMTROOPER.

That doesn't change the fact that the writing for Finn was just terrible. Because the films were made to be sjw pandering machines, Finn was forced to be this blubbering and cowardly idiot. Had tumbler fan fic movies actually tried, they could've gone into more details about Finn's past. Maybe some PTSD that he had to deal with? Oh and maybe having Phasma become a recurring foil for Fin throughout the trilogy instead of getting killed in a really dumb way in TFA?

Boyega would've been SOOOO much better as Poe. Why did he have to use a fake American accent again? They could've let him roll with bis accent and played jis character up so much more.

It's just another example of why the fan fic non-canon new trilogy movies are just terrible.
