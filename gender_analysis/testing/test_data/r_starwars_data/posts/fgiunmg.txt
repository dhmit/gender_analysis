When most war movies are set in a time before instant communication or any digital media, it is impossible to not show any books or written texts.

When more movies are being made about modern wars - and wars that haven't started yet - they will easily have no books or letters.

So far this year, I've read four novels, dozens of comics, and communicated with people around the world without ever using paper. By the logic of this theory, I'm also illiterate, because no one saw me do it.

We also went 42 years without seeing a toilet in the Star Wars universe, but that doesn't mean they didn't exist.
