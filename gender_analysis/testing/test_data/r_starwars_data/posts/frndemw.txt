He literally got the shaft in pretty much all regards in my opinion. They played this teaser about him possibly becoming a jedi which didn't happen. We saw him have a crush on Rey that never went anywhere EVEN in the last movie. They entertained a bond between him and Rose that never went anywhere after TLJ. 

They pretty much had so many different directions they could've taken his character in, and stopped them before they ever really took off. 

I was HIGHLY disappointed with the way they ended TROS. No real resolve to his character or even Poe's for that matter (but Finn definitely got the short end of the stick by far).
