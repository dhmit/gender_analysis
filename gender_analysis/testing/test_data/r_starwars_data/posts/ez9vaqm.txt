I stand by my principle to never get any Battlefront game without GC. With modern capabilities, so much more can be done with that game mode than OG BF2 did, yet I would still be happy with just that. 

On a related note: if anyone knows of any Risk-like shooters, where war strategy is a mechanic (meaning losing one battle doesn’t mean losing the war, like in Galactic Conquest), but it’s still a shooter, I’m open to suggestions.
