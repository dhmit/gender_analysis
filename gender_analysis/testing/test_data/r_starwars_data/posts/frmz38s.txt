My feeling is, that the problem lies within the different directors of the ST. JJ thinks leaving a shit ton of open questions is exciting because people get to speculate (I think it’s lazy and a movie should not leave so many questions unanswered) and Johnson tried to subvert expectations on each and every speculation regardless of whether his decision makes a compelling story for a Star Wars movie (I’m writing that because maybe TLJ was a good movie, but to me it was an absolutely horrible Star Wars movie).
