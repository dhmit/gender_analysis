Originally, they were supposed to have a big Wampa problem in the Hoth base.  There was meant to be coordinated attacks just before the Empire arrives.  This scene is just an extension of that.  Without the rest of the context though, this scene would make no sense to put back into the final movie.

Also originally, wampas were supposed to vanish in a "burst of vapor" because they were essentially wraiths.
