Are you sure? As far as I know Ben's hut is vaporised by Dr. Aphra & Vader in the first comic series featuring him, set after A New Hope. 

They're trying to find traces of Luke after Boba Fett's duel with Luke in the hut, but after finding nothing they vaporise it with a bomb.

Due to this Luke wouldn't be able to go back to create his saber in any of the Disney comics, unless they've messed up the continuity.
