Only because they ruined him in the last jedi. If it wasn't for that girl that out of nowhere showed up and that nobody liked. He could have made a pretty cool force sensitive dude. And yea his sacrifice was nice but I feel like it was too early. At that point I still feel like he was the runaway trooper. If they had used lj as a way of showing how he had been training under Pho then fly away in an xwing to that planet Canto Bight, solo get what he needs then follow the same story until the battle of Crait. There instead of a half finished love story Pho says:"don't fight what you hate but protect what you love." making Finn realise that he cares for his friends and has more use alive. So he returns with the fighter after destroying at least a few trooper cannons. Fast forward to the battle of Exegol where Disney did it a bit better with the story lines. All I would change is that Finn would have a convo with Pho over the comes where he accepts his end using Pho's words:"as you said man, I am protecting what I love." Then the Millennium Falcon can come and safe them or not. That is not important as we now see Fin as a true Rebel.
