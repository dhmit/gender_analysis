Episode IX:

An indigenous but complicated force sensitive species, the Skowes, live on a forest planet (Not Endor...it's mainly oak trees) where our heroes will fly the Falcon to and attempt to make contact with. Powerful force wielders, the Skowes will use their powers to throw boulders and trees at First Order equipment in an attempt to aid the Resistance and the remnant New Republic forces with disabling the device powering a new super weapon. Ray will go off on her own and confront Kylo who will realize the importance of embracing both the light and the dark, bringing balance to the force. Together, they set of a powerful chain reaction with their powers that will aid small resistance fighters with destroying the First Order and restoring peace to the Galaxy. General Hux is most displeased and screams in anger as his super weapon explodes around him. Boom. Lens flare everyone. Lens. Flare.

Ray and Kylo go on a grand tour promoting a balance of the dark and light sides and training students in the use of balancing their powers while creating a constitutional monarchy that gives us the best of the imperial system with the best of the Republican one.
