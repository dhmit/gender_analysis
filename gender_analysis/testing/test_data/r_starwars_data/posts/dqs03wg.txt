Got the pleasure of meeting Tom Hanks when he was performing for a play in NYC. 

I was attending a military boarding school from Kansas on a cultural trip. I guess one of the theater managers had heard we were in attendance, and somehow, word got to Tom Hanks and we were asked backstage after the show.

Absolutely the kindest and most down-to-earth celebrity I've had the pleasure of meeting. He took the time to get to know each of us and our background a little, asked about the school, and took a couple pictures.

We ended up sending him a lettermans jacket and he sent us a letter typed on that typewriter he uses thanking each of us and sent us pictures of him wearing the jacket out in public. Absolutely a stand up guy. 

We also got to meet Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore who was performing in the same play, but it was so unexpected all I could think to say was "that's the guy who eats shit for breakfast"
