The prequels has some lame dialogue and were kinda cheesy but the story was cohesive and didn’t have a bunch of terrible, glaring plot holes. This is because they were written as a cohesive story.  The sequels were not so. 

JJ was given a blank slate (after Disney gave George and his fully fleshed out story the finger) then a totally different guy with a totally different agenda made a movie and said in that movie that they needed to kill the old ways and start anew. So he totally wrecked JJ’s story foundation. So Disney brought back JJ to put it all back together and all he did was resurrect Palpatine. The sequels suck in so many ways the prequels never could. 

The prequels got better with age and the more we scrutinize the sequels the worse they will become. It’s a fucking shame they are somehow canon.
