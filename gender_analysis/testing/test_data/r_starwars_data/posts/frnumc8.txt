Yea I really liked TLJ. It's a strong movie, even though it was shouldering the load of repairing TFA's weaknesses. If a stronger team were in charge of writing/directing TROS I think the whole trilogy could've ended up in a good place. The alternative plan for TROS, before JJ took over, seems like it would've done well on that score.
