Copied from another reply I just made as it applies in whole:

Y'all are missing the point worse than a storm trooper on the ds-1...  It's not that it isn't realistic that's the issue, it's the fact that it's completely inconsistent with the established universe.  If it's a viable tactic (as yes, I admit it should be based on physics) then it would be used LITERALLY EXCLUSIVELY against capital ships (you could argue snubs are too maneuverable to hit).

I also find it funny that the argument consists of "it's fantasy guyz" then you immediately fall back to physics.... Lol.
