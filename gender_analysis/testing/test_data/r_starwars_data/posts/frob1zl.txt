It's because Finn fucking sucks most of his screen time is him just breathing heavy and saying Rey. 

NO ONE has good character development in the series except Kylo Ren but after 3 movies Finn is the same person he was at the beginning and that's not even an interesting one. Of the group Finn is definitely the least likable and his scenes feel like they drag on and on.
