I disagree.  The Sith vary between Lawful Evil and Chaotic Evil depending on the Sith Lord.

Palpatine and Vader still used the rule of law, governments, etc, but to their own ends.  IMO:

Rebels - Chaotic Good

Jedi - Neutral Good / True Neutral

Sith - Chaotic Evil, Evil, Lawful Evil

Bounty Hunters - Chaotic Neutral
