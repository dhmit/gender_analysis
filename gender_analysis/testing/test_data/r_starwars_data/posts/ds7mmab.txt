Only addressing your last point, it would basically always be worth it, assuming you could destroy the enemy ship (and the combatants in star wars would know what is required) because you are not only taking out an enemy hyper drive, but presumably a fully manned and armed ship, while yours is going to die anyways (that is the reason why you would kamikaze)
