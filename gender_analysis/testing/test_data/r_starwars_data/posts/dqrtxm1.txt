Not just that, but he puts a lot of his own money back towards the charities and causes he supports.  Not just Make-A-Wish either, he's involved with anti-bullying movements, hunger movements, LGBT rights movements (it was a big shock for some to see WWE put together the "We're All in This Together" video last year). He doesn't seem to do *anything* by halves.  Even his character style shows that - if he's a heel, he's gonna be the best damn heel he can be.
