I have no reasonable expectation of ever becoming famous let alone *that* famous but, if I did, I’d wanna be the kinda person that does these things. 
Mark Hamill gets it. He understands how important that role is and how it shaped, and continues to shape, the lives of people all around the world. Only a handful of actors ever get to experience this and even fewer make good on it.
Hollywood could really take a page out of his book in realizing that it is about the fans and not their money. It’s about showing young boys and girls that in the face of great struggle, one person *can* make a difference. 

May the force be with you
