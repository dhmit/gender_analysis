4-6 were thrown together far more than people realize, too. Lucas had some idea of what was going to happen after New Hope, but the extent to which he had it planned out is overblown. And really watching with a critical eye, you see how the seams -

But, mainly because they had one boss guy, they hold up well enough for a cohesive story. 

7-9 are always going to be such a disappointment. Such a missed opportunity. Not the biggest JJ fan, but they should have just given him all 3. If it's a trilogy, it needs one story guy.
