Technically there are tons of force sensitives. Remember not all of them became Jedi, a lot of them winded up being sent to the agricore (farming and such in a Jedi controlled system because they were all trained to be Jedis even though all of them did not become Jedi) or doctors and such. So the precedence is there already (Obi almost didn't become a jedi because no Master would take him, Jinn literally grabbed him at the last second).

 On top of that being force sensitive wouldn't be enough. Han is force sensitive (this is alluded to several times) but he can't use the Force really at all. Being force sensitive can range from mundane things like never getting lost to badass lightsaber skills. I doubt they gathered all the force sensitive kids they could and kept then considering Palpatine had Vader kill all the kids in the temple (even the babies which would have been perfect for turning to the dark) then again he could have changed his mind later on.
