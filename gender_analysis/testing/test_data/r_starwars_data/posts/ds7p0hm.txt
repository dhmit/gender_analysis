>It still sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Hyperspace Ramming sounds a lot like mutually assured destruction. If one side starts using this as a weapon to incur Mass murder, then the other side will start using it. Which results in EVERYONE dead. No one wants everyone dead on both sides.

I agree, that DOES sound reasonable, so why doesn't everyone do it in the prior movies when they know they are going to lose?
