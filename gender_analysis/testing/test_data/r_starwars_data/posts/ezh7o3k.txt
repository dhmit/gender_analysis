This comment [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dpq6up2/) makes me realize just how pathetic and greedy the game industry has gotten, We've come to a point to where unlocking in game items like badass weapons and cosmetics by actually beating a level or hard boss is over, Now devs are so greedy they pull out the nice unlockables and put them behind a paywall and no one bats an eye because weve normalized "cosmetic only" micro-transactions as acceptable. People dont bat an eye because they're like "Oh its cosmetic only so it doesnt let anyone pay to win". But your missing the point that unlocking these in game items by playing and not PAYING is why we started playing video games in the first place. When you take away the reward for playing then you lose the will to continue the game and it gets stale and you eventually quit and move onto another game. AAA games don't even excite me anymore because Its always the same stupid shit, it always has to have some kind of in game monetization system after you already paid $80 for the collectors edition. No longer are the days when you can just pay full price and have all the stuff and unlock extra cool shit in game that makes you play it more or even restart the game over to find more badass unlockables. Why is it so hard for these game publishers/devs to realize this?
