It also had a certain dramatic irony. Anakin and Padmé were in love but outside of their couple, they were basically ennemies. Anakin becoming Palpatine's lapdog and Padmé becoming his fiercest opponent.

They even had concept art of Padmé with a dagger on Mustafar. A wound inflicted on Anakin trying to kill him could have weakened him, explaining how Obi-Wan could defeat Anakin. (Yes, the high ground is a funny meme but in an open field, it's not that big an advantage.)
