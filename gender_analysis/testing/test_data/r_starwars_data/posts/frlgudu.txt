If there is I would like to read it. At least then there would not be an issue with everyone and their mother being force sensitive because it would make sense why so many people are able to be sensitive to it. Even if there was something that showed a vast majority of the population is actually force sensitive. Preferably something that was made in the past before the movies came out. Otherwise if they introduce some written article NOW that everyone is force sensitive it kinda ruins the previous canon material and how rare it was to be force sensitive.
