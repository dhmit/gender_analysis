They nailed the casting for the ST, and then they completely wasted their cast's potential by not planning out a cohesive story. Disney is a smart company, obviously, because of how they've been able to control so much of the market. It's baffling to me that they let this happen to one of their biggest franchises. Sure, the ST made money, but now people are just over Star Wars movies. Had they made a great trilogy, fans would be dying to get more.
