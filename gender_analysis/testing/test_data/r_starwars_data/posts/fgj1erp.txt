As an aside, would this go against asimovs law of robotics? Yes right. His direct action caused a human harm. But what if he was told to remove all the yeti signs, but not WHY he was removing them? The result would be the same, dude getting yucked by yeti, but as an unknown result of the robot...makes me think.
