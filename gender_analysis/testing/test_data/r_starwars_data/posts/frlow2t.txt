I think that the third possibility is that the Jedi were looking for a certain kind of force sensitive people, and they had a galactic spanning network searching for those people.  Or perhaps it takes a great event for some people to 'unlock' their force sensitivity.  

The Wheel of Time had this with their channelers.  The Aes Sedai were the main magical organization for the first half of the series and they were always lamenting that there were not enough girls who could channel.  Some people were born able to channel, some could do so with limited training, and others required a large amount of training to unlock their power.  That said, all groups could grow to be mostly equal in power.  

Half way through the series its discovered that the Aes Sedai, who were looking for what they knew, weren't looking the right way at all.  There were MANY more channelers than they though.  

I think that might be an interesting way of posting more 'force sensitives'  It wasn't that Finn was force sensitive so he realized what he was doing was wrong, but the fact that he overcame all of his conditioning and had a major epiphany that caused him to unlock his force sensitivity.  I like this take because it makes people like Finn far more responsible for their own actions.
