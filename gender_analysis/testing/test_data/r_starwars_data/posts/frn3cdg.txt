JJ failed? I don’t get why its hard to remember that Lawrence Kasdan (writer of the scripts for ESB and ROTJ from Lucas’s notes) co-wrote the script with him and Kennedy, who had control over everything, never seem to take the blame. JJ and the other directors never got full creative control. Only one director got that: Rian Johnson. All the JJ “mystery boxes” had answers. The problem is Johnson got to freely do what he wanted and never cared about answering anything. Take the character of Snoke, our main villain. Zero character development. When you created a trilogy, you don’t answer everything in the first movie. You leave certain things to be explored in the next two films of the trilogy.
