Finn was robbed. They gave him a lightsaber in the first one just to replace it with a bullshit empire weapon after maiming him. 

I hope he stays away from the star wars franchise altogether, can't say that I loved his character but there was no way he deserved that treatment.  Last 3movies were garbage anyway, some distance would do him good.
