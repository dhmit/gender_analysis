Essential tremor.

I have it. Ever since I can remember I have had unsteady hands.

Stress, excitement and other things make it better or worse.

For me, I own a brewery so I just think most people assume I am having alcohol withdrawals even though I drink less now than before opening a brewery.

It did make bartending difficult as I had to find ways to overcome it.
