Probably because the Execs didn't want the possibility of Rey being overshadowed by a male, which, reflecting on all three movies, would have been very easily done.

Maybe (certainly) I'm not the target audience of the ST being a male in my mid-twenties, but I can't see Rey resonating with anyone but pre-teen girls. A very weak character in a sea of weak characters imo.
