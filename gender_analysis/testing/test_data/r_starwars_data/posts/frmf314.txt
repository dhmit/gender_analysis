Where the prequels could've excelled is where the sequels failed, and vise versa. 

The prequels introduced a world to us that was a layer deeper than just black vs white, evil vs good. They introduced the idea that there's a system that's thousands of systems deep, that the system is politically rotten. It strives to blur the line between good and bad, and provide a question to the viewer if the Jedi are actually a force for good in the universe.

At least, this was the hope. Bad writing pretty well killed it. Anakin/Padme's relationship was horribly forced and Papa Palpatine was never really convincing to anyone about how the Jedi may actually have flaws. I watched the prequels with my SO over the past month and couldn't get over how badly paced the writing was and how childish and dumb downed certain things seemed. To myself, the prequels should've been a much more mature series that was written at a higher level. Anakin's turn to the dark side seemed at best, forced. 

On the flip side TFA and the recent movies have great production value, talented actors and tight writing. The pacing is kept relatively well, the story progression is much better than in the prequels and while you can tell it was due in part to the gobs of cash thrown at it; its digestible. At least until the most recent film. 

The issue is that in their writing they failed to do everything the prequels did right. They didn't build on the New Republic and WHY they're so neutered against the FO. They didn't really go into the gritty details of the universe that fans wanted to see. Instead, we ended up with Death Star 3: Planet Boogaloo edition. Except instead of exhaust ports in a trench, it was an exhaust port on a pimple.

Personally I think if the Starforge wasn't considered canon, that should've been the "Superweapon" of the series. A massive installation that basically pumps out starships by utilizing harvested stellar material. It could've answered the question: "How the fuck did the First Order get this shit?" and could've neatly tied in the content from the third and final movie without it being a convoluted mess. It could've also drawn the superweapon out across three movies and kept the stakes high, with each movie revealing more about this eventual enemy; as opposed to each movie seemingly taking on it's own "Villain".
