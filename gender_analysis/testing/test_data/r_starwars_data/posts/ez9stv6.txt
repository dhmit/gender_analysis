Absolutely. The game still has some bugs but it has gotten a lot of new (ALL FREE) content, and there are still plans to support the game past 2019.

By the end of September, we are getting a Clone Commando class, a 4 player co op mode, single player Instant Action (similar to the original Battlefront 2), and Felucia as a new map. And we are getting new classes and a new map for The Rise of Skywalker later this year (probably Nov/Dec) 

All microtransactions are purely cosmetic (skins for heroes and troopers) and can still be acquired through in game currency. No loot boxes or anything like that.
