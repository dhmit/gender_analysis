We barely see any leisure activities, and when we do they are in settings that are suggested to be full of criminals, if not entirely illegal. I don't think Jabba is a big reader, but that doesn't mean the galaxy is illiterate.

When we do see leisure that isn't also a crime den, it's going to be visual because these are movies. We see sports and music and ballet; we don't see people sitting quietly in the corner reading.

We do, however, see Yularen reading when he suspects Admiral Trench to be the commander of a Separatist ship.
