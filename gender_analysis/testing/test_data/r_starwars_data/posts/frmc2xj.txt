Not sure how credible this is but I hear China doesnt want to see black protagonists in movies. Theyre deeply racist against black people in China and Disney will do anything for the chinese market. Wouldn't be surprised if the CCP called Disney and told them to sabotage Finn's story line or else the movies wouldn't be shown in China.
