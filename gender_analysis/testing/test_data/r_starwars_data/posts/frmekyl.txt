Obi-wan is EXACTLY the kind of master that would fail to talk to Anakin about that. You know how I know? He straight up said, "I have failed you Anakin." Failed him how? The great fall of the jedi order. The rise of the empire. It all started because Obi-wan felt it too awkward to tell Anakin how to have safe sex. That was how Obi-wan failed him. Coulda headed this whole thing off with 5 minutes of awkward biology and a pack of condoms.
