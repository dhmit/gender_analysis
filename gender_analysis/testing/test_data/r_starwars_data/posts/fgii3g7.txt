I'm always confused about how people (Jedi/Sith) build light sabers.  It seems like the Ilum thing is canon now where Jedi go to an ice planet and hunt a kyber crystal.  There are seem to be kyber crystals in Jedha since you see the Empire stealing them in Rogue One. Do they just show up to a planet, find a crystal and call it a day? Why don't other people do this too?
