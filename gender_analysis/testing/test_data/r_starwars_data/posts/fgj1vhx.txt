Yeah, "Star Wars fans" probably isn't one person holding all of those views. But even if they are, that would just show that the general audience isn't good at articulating why they like/dislike something.

When people try to justify their feeling about something, they just end up describing obvious attributes of the thing, even if that's not the core of what they didn't like. 

I'm a software developer and I have a motto that I think applies here: "Customers are always right when they think there's a problem, and almost always wrong about what the problem is."
