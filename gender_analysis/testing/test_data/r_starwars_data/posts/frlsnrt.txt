Is it bad that I found myself secretly hoping for some future for his character as a Jedi? He clearly was receptive of the force and could have easily become a Jedi. 
I dunno, considering the Disney take over I just kinda thought they would look for spin offs wherever they could find one I guess. 
I’ll remain hopeful. 🤞🏻
