Yes but had Padme not been running around chasing after Anakin and getting force choked while heavily pregnant, she probably would have lived.  Whether you buy the "loss of will to live" or siphoning of life force to reanimate Vader, Anakin's choosing to side with Palpatine led to her death.  Anakin's vision was a self-fulfilling prophecy; his drive to save her ended up resulting in her death.  If they had been allowed to marry openly, he may never have had those visions at all or even if she DID die, he could have raised their child(ren) without fear of retribution.
