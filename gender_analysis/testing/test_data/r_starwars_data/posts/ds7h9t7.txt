I have a new baby so no NYE party for me this year. Instead I did this same thing. It was great!

My observations:
1. The final battle is much shorter than I remember as a kid. The heroes were still on the Death Star at like 11:45pm. I was thinking I messed it up, but no, the battle is just that short. 

2. After DS destruction this movie wraps up rapidly. Even with the throne room scene I was still tucked into bed by 12:15am
