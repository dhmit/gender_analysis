The mystery of who ordered the Clones wasn't supposed to be a mystery. It was supposed to be "Sido Dyas". You know, Sidious? It was Papa Palpatine who went to Kamino to create Clones with the intent of manufacturing a war so that he could then recruit them as his own personal army. The audience was supposed to know this.

But George has fat fingers and pressed F instead of D. And just left it in the script. So it was "Sifo Dyas" who ordered the Clones. Who was Sifo Dyas? The movie doesn't explain it. The whole conspiracy barely made sense as it was and adding yet another character made it worse. It took years later for Filoni to get around to answering it.
