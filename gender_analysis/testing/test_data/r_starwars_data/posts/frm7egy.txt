Dying because of sadness is dumb. However, Padme dying because Anakin got caught up in his quest for power and choked the fuck out of her is way better story telling than the Emperor doing some dumb life drain bullshit. Puts an ironic twist on the the story and fully makes Vaderâ€™s fall his own fault.
