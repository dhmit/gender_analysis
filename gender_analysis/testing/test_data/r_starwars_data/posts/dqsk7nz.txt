I wish I could just ask him about how he feels about going in as an actor and then forever being remembered as a film icon. Then after decades going back into the role after probably thinking you wouldn't have to do it again. He's also an icon in my mind in the voice acting world as of course joker but I didn't know like Skywalker was also the joker. It was a mind blowing moment as a kid
