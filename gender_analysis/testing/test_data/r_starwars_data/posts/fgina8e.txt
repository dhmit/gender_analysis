Glad it wasn't in. Not the right moment for a dumb gag. 

Also, since no one else has mentioned it, anyone remember having to kill three of these things In Star Wars Trilogy Arcade?

I fucking loved that game. Would play it at every arcade. Got so good I could do the whole thing on one credit. I can't find them any more though. They got too old.
