This is great.

It also undoes a lot of the overkill that is the Final Order.

I mean not only are there seemingly countless Destroyers, they are all armed with Death Star Lasers? Overkill, overkill, overkill like a bad anime.

By all rights the Final Order should be *completely* unstoppable even after that big dick fleet came in.

If Finn could get a few dozen ships disabled by mutiny and a few others completely turned "good guys" and start firing on each other you'd have a really epic scene as Finn starts to decimate parts of the order by pitting it against itself.

Have some command ship somehow take control and start reorganizing around the battle and defeat the small pockets of rebellion untilt he Lando scene happens.

Then you have Finn with ex-soldiers land on the Command Ship and take it out with an exiles vs Final Order battle on a Destroyer which gives them and the Lando group an edge. But instead of just the rejects from Endor you'd have newly turned stormtroopers who are discarding their armor and shit running down to help the good guys.
