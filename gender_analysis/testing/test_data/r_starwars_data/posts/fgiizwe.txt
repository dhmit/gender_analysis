u/KingHankXII is right about this. The construction requires the Force. Additionally actually finding the proper crystal requires the Force as well, as each crystal can only be attuned by one Jedi whose personality and attributes determine the blade color at the time of construction. The Sith on the other hand are supposed to find a Jedi, kill them and take their Kyber crystal, then corrupt it and force it to attune to them which is why the blade comes out as Red. Itâ€™s a mix of science and mysticism according to new canon as opposed to straight science in Legends.
