All the time, these idiots are crying about how the lootboxes suck and back in the day you had to work to unlock things. Now there's a game where you have to work to unlock things, and suddenly it's unfair and everyone's crying because they can't play Vader day one. And NOW, years later, they're making sure history is rewritten to say that the things they didn't want to work towards getting were actually loot boxes, so in hindsight it doesn't look like they had a temper tantrum over having work to unlock stuff.
