I don't give a fuck. You don't get to market Finn as the first black Star Wars lead for woke points, with all the marketing material pointing to him being a Jedi, only to shaft him completely in the next 2 films. Disney is absolutely wrong for this. 

I know exactly why Disney would do something like this, and it's not impressive. They only care about representation insofar as they can use it for marketing purposes, and then after that they don't give a shit. I'd rather they be honest that they're a piece-of-shit multinational media conglomerate who only cares about money than try and pretend like they actually care about racial diversity. That way, characters like Finn would have a lesser chance of being fucked over the way he was.
