I feel like the movie should have ended with Rey dying, kylo walking out with his father's lightsaber,  and hearing Anakin Skywalker's voice say..."Ben." 

Finn's character development did suck and they could do more with him. But, the real mistake was not capatilizing on the actual SKYWALKER of the film.
