Obviously one instance of paper doesn't ruin everything, but it is at least noteworthy that several of these long running rules were suddenly broken back to back. No flashbacks is another one that comes to mind. It leaves an unfamiliar feel that requires something amazing to balance it.

Each new film has some of these rule breaks of course. Last Jedi just happens to be the "Let the past die" film, so naturally it wants to break all the rules big and small.
