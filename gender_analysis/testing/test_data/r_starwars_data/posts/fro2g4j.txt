In response to your first paragraph, no shit the middle film of a trilogy is going to introduce concepts and plot points without resolving every single one. You're just reminding me of why TROS did such a bad job as a sequel, all those ideas never got reintroduced in any meaningful way.

As for Finn, I'm tired of repeating myself, but he's still focused on self-preservation even at the end of TFA. You seem to be under the impression that he stood up to Kylo Ren out of some heroic desire to save the galaxy, while conveniently forgetting that he was only there to save Rey and he only fought Kylo to save Rey. That all changes over the course of TLJ; it's not retread, it's actually expanded on like a good film should do.
