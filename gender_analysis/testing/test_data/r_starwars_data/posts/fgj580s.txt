There was a subplot with the Wampa's invading the base and causing havoc. They were forced into a part of the base that was under development and locked them in. It's been released as a long deleted scene. They cut it out because the costumes and effects for the Wampa's didnt look good. There's a few episodes of the animated Forces of Destiny shorts where some of these scenes are somewhat recanonized. Leia and Chewie deal with them.
