Maybe the holocrons were copies of them? 

But we have to think, obviously the universe existed at a point without technology. Is the Jedi order, in a rudimentary form, that old? If so, there had to be some form of paper to write down their ideas. 

Is it possible that these are those first texts, and were unknown to the current/prequel Jedi at the time? Maybe? 

Itâ€™s either that, or we just straight up call it a retcon and move on with the idea.
