When I saw TFA on opening night I left the theater relatively happy. Yeah, it was a ANH remake more or less, but it was enjoyable to watch and all of the non-story stuff was well crafted. I liked the new characters and wanted to see what happened with them.

But then, after even just the smallest modicum of thought and examination of the film over the next day or so I just started to feel like there were so many dumb things. It only got worse from there.
