By author are you referring to me or the script writer? 

If me, then I disagree with that straw man argument. There is some nuance here with these ideas. Just because you’re not force sensitive or “born with the correct DNA” doesn’t mean you can’t be great. Which is why I feel bad for Finn. They should have made him or Poe like the new Han Solo gun slinger.
