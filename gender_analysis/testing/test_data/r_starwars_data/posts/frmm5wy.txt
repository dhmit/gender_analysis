I just want to throw this out regarding Anakin/Padme: I think it could've come across a lot better if they made Anakin older in TPM. For me, even as a younger viewer at the time, it was weird as hell having them have that attraction between characters when it started out as Natalie Portman and young Jake Lloyd. I understand why they wanted a younger kid, but if all the Jedi Council is just going to resist training on the grounds of "he's too old" anyways, just make him older and start planting the seeds of their chemistry in TPM (no, the "are you an angel?" line doesn't count to me). It puts too much pressure on AotC because now you have to reconcile that weird age gap by changing actors for Anakin and flesh out their entire relationship in one movie, while maintaining Obi Wan and Dooku's plotlines and the screentime you need for that. It was a bunch of spinning plates that the movie just couldn't support, especially with bad dialogue. I think ultimately that inability to pace their romance was perhaps just as big of an issue as the dialogue
