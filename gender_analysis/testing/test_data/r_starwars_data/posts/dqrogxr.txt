"When he was eight or nine, Hamill had dinner with his father at Bistro in Beverly Hills, after the family had settled in California. He remembers seeing stars like Vivian Vance and being too nervous to approach them. When Groucho Marx came in, Hamill dared to walk over, matchbook in hand, to ask for an autograph. The legendary comedian asked the boy his name, then went into character. “Mark Camel? You don’t look like a camel!” Hamill’s impersonation is spot-on.

“It was effortless,” Hamill says. “He signed the matches, and I went back to my seat. Later, he got up to go to the men’s room and did the slouch walk. He knew I was sitting there. He did it just for me. I’ll never forget it.” Hamill, for his part, is famously tolerant of the hordes of Star Wars fans who continue to approach him for autographs and selfies. When the studio offered to screen a cut of The Last Jedi for him and his family, he declined, saying he’d rather wait to watch it with a crowd."
