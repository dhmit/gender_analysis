Haven't played the game since launch, got swept up in the "bad game" crowd and never played it until around 2 months ago. But since I've been playing it has been like that. So more time than a single patch, although it may be a more intricate problem so may take a while to fix, who knows. I've been having fun anyway, so I'm fine with waiting on a fix from dice
