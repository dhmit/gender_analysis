See the issue here is part of the lore of hyperspace. Hyperspace is an alternate dimension. So once you actually jump into hyperspace, you're not in the "real" world anymore, and real objects only cast a "shadow" in that world. If a shadow is massive enough to interact with you in hyperspace, it'll pull you out of hyperspace entirely, and neuter your speed. If it isn't large enough, you'll pass through it unharmed. Either way, ramming isn't a valid tactic when in hyperspace. We actually see this in TFA, Starkiller Base pulls the falcon out of hyperspace very abruptly when it enters its atmosphere.

The Raddus didn't actually collide with the Supremacy while *in* hyperspace. You know that little segment we see during all jumps to hyperspace where the stars just kinda stretch before you actually enter hyperspace? That's when the collision happened. When you're just approaching the lightspeed limit, but are not actually in hyperspace.

The easiest evidence of this is that in the collision we see the effects of the Raddus hitting the Supremacy in the "pre hyperspace" phase is the fact that space appears black in that sequence, not the bright blue colour we see when ships are in hyperspace. 

To achieve the ramming in that pre phase, you need to be close to the enemy. Otherwise you'll accelerate past lightspeed before you hit them, and thus you'll be not even touch them because you're in an alternate dimension.
