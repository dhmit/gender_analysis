I 100% disagree that he should have been a jedi. I loved that in the force awakens he defected because he just thought it was the right thing to do. It was cool that he was just a stormtrooper with a good heart. This leads to why I completely hate that they strongly hinted at Finn being force sensitive in episode 9. They basically made it seem like the force guided him to defect but in my opinion its better if he was never force sensitive but instead just a regular stormtrooper who wanted to do the right thing.
