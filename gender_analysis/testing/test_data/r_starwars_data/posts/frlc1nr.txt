That’s the theory. I don’t think it was ever confirmed canon, but in the scene where she dies I’m pretty sure the scene transition is palpatines evil cackle and then him resurrecting Anakin as Vader. It’s heavily implied that he stole her life force, but never officially confirmed. I choose to believe it because once pointed out it’s obvious that the implication was there, albeit a weak one.
