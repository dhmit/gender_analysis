Oh, the Anthony Daniels/C3P0 is a hero moment :). 
FYI, as far as I know, that's just a part of a whole storyline that was filmed where Wampas attacked the rebel base on Hoth. From RLM I've heard that Anthony Daniels was pushing for a hero moment for C3P0 from the get go, OG to prequels, but Lucas was just "nah he's allways scared" and that's his role in the movie. To see that he actually did have a hero moment (40 years ago!) that got left on the cutting room floor must have hurt :)
