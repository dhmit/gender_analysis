Finn was such a cool character, it actually could’ve made the new trilogy an actual good franchise because it’d be about a rouge stormtrooper fighting against what he once put his life on the line for, but instead we got a lowly desert planet dweller just like Luke, except unlike Luke, Rey is kind of really unlikable at certain movie points. But I just really really hate how they portrayed Finn in later movies. He just felt so unplanned and unfinished, they had no idea as to what to do, like they removed the scene where he kissed rey in the 7th one, they completely glossed Over the kiss with rose, and in the 9th one, they do nothing with him. It’s even hinted that he likes Rey because he said he wanted to tell her something before they sunk into quicksand, and they bring it up like one time BUT THEY NEVER FUCKING REVEAL IT OR BRING IT UP AFTER THAT AGAIN. That is the most infuriating and fucking stupid methods ever when making a movie. Hint at a possible big secret? Build suspense and make the audience ask questions? Well too bad! Those questions are never getting answered
