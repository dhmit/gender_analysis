I would’ve loved a kotorii situation, with multiple Jedi in the crew. 

Imagine Luke doesn’t die (or does idc) and successfully trains try BEFORE she displays powers or technique. Then she trains Finn. 

They both go against kylo and he kills luke (or he sacrifices himself idc) . You could even throw the romantic shit, and that makes kylo turn. Then you have three Jedi’s against snoke, and he has either the army or some clones or even kylo clones that storm the three jedis.

By then reinforcement comes and Poe comes with everyone else, chewbacca leads the ground army, along general organa. And then, having displayed powers (minor powers) in the series, she fully embraces the Jedi way, tho still prefer guns . Maybe Han is still alive (or don’t idc) but we see general organa force pushing the shit out of Kylo clones while shooting them. Her kylo has the shitty sword .

Snoke tries to flee but is confronted by force ghost Luke and company. He’s surprised, but prepares to get away when he realises he’s just been stabbed by the three jedis which force throwed their lightsabers . Then his head explodes. Leía shot him dead for good.
