I dunno, the way I see that question is would you rather have the world be “looking at their success some people are just chosen to be greater than others, learn your place” or that “despite their success they’re not actually more exceptional than you, and you shouldn’t preclude yourself from striving to be greater”. 

I’m more impartial to the latter.
