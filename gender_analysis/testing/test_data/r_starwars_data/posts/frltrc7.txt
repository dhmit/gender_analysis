That line could’ve worked IMO, it’s not even the worst piece of love dialogue from the movie. The problem is more that the romance was weak and hard to believe and we never actually saw them holding each other lovingly like that. And Padme really wasn’t given much of a reason to be nostalgic for the old days of their love.
