Exactly why I'm still miffed that all of the scenes with Padmé, Mon Mothma, and the Delegation of 2,000 got cut from ROTS. It had Padmé in a more active role as opposed to a trophy for Anakin to protect, and it also served to let Palpatine to further lure Anakin to his side, sowing more distrust for the current system (and his wife) within him.
