Actually while the purple lightsaber may or may not have something to do with the red+blue concept (I think it's just coincidence) Mace "Window" is written in some maybe-still-canon-I-dunno side book or something as being the inventor of or at least championing a fighting style that is very "on the edge" for a Jedi because it relies heavily on emotion - especially anger. I think it was a style Jedi were generally forbidden or at least discouraged from using for that reason. I don't remember the details and I am lazy but if you're curious I'm sure you can find it on his Wookieepedia page
