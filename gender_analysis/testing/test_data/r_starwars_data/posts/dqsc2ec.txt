I think I needed to hear this (even though I'm a woman). Super excited for Star Wars next week and I have a feeling it'll be heavy (as always) and I'll likely cry. I was feeling embarrassed about it. I mean, hell, I get teary eyed when I see new trailers. I had to calm myself down when the recent phase of Marvel films were announced several years ago ðŸ˜‚ I was that excited. But I never considered that it was out of the passion I have for the series, I just thought I was an embarrassing dork
