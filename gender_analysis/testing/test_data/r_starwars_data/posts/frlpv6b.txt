For real though. The very idea of a former stormtrooper being force sensitive and bringing balance to the force is unworldly awesome. Instead they threw fucking palpetine in there for seemingly no reason. I think my biggest issue is that the movies didn’t have an over plot line that flowed through the three of them. The characters are the same, but that’s it.
