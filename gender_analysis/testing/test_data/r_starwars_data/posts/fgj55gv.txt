Warning: This is all now non-canon, so take with a grain of salt if you want only canon answers. 

The Jedi were over 25,000 years old as an Order by the sequels, and their predecessor, the Je’daii Order were formed in 36,453 BBY. 

By this point in time, Coruscant was already a Galactic City for over 50,000 years. The Wookiees were nearly two million years old as a species. 160,000 years prior, spaceflight was a thing, and what became humans drove another species (what became the Mandalorians) off of Coruscant. 

I struggle to believe that the Jedi would have used paper to make their ancient texts with that context. 

I know it’s all scrapped now, but it’s definitely a retcon.
