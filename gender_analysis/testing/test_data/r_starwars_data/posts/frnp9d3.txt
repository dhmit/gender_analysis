I think they didn’t do enough with his Stormtrooper background. He doesn’t seem to struggle with his long period of subordination under the vice grip of the Order. 
Maybe when he joins the Resistance, he has a tendency to blindly follow orders, only to realize that sometimes you need to go against command to do the right thing.
Maybe, if they didn’t want him to become a Jedi, he could have shown more of his skills as a Trooper; have him rely on strategy and tactics in fights, and figure out inventive ways to probe the Order’s weaknesses (and no, just knowing how to get into Starkiller base because he was a JANITOR or whatever doesn’t count).
Maybe they should have done more with his relationship with Captain Phasma, fleshing her out in the process as well.
