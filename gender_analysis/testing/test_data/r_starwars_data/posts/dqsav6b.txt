Thats because Mark and John understand that these characters and these personalities of John Cena the wrestler and Luke Skywalker are so much more than characters on a screen. Theyâ€™re symbols of determination, of not giving up against all odds and to keep fighting no matter what and they understand how powerful these images are to children and to people of all all ages and thats something really special when a celebrity realizes that their characters are bigger than them and now its their turn to uphold their values and I think thats something the world really needs.
