Stories like this are really touching, but they also worry me a little bit. Sadly, there are thousands of dying kids in the world. Are they all going to read this and think they can get a personal day with Mark Hamill? There aren't enough Mark Hamills to go around. I'm not at all saying he shouldn't do it... I just hope that everyone talking about it doesn't create unrealistic demands/expectations on people in his position.
