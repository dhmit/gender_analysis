See, I dunno about that. While Rian certainly went into different directions than many of us were expecting, I think that by in large almost everything can be traced back to something and make sense. It's carefully crafted to do so, that's his style of writing.

I think the fact that J.J. made both TFA and TROS, and TLJ is such a different film in terms of the cinematography and themes, that people automatically assume TLJ is the offender. After all, it looks the most different.

But the issue is that TROS doesn't just undercut things that TLJ was doing, it *also* undercuts TFA, and often more so does that.

For example, many complained about Rey nobody in TLJ, but if you look at TFA, there is absolutely nothing that links Rey to anyone with some sort of family bond. Additionally there were interviews where Daisy Ridley thought they said what they needed to know already, and J.J. talks explicitly about how to him the Force was more than midichlorians or where you came from, but something anyone could have. Suddenly in the final movie Rey has a family bond, and people take it as a giant middle finger to Rian Johnson and TLJ.

TLJ just continued what TFA was saying. Maz tells Rey her parents don't matter to this story and they aren't coming back. Suddenly they're the most important thing in the story because it's the motivation for basically everything since Palpatine now needs her to continue his legacy. J.J. is so bad about this that not only does he do this to himself multiple times in regards to his own movie in TFA, but he does it to himself within TROS itself. First Kylo needs to kill Rey, then Rey is needed to Palpatine can pass his spirit into her?? Then why did he want her dead, so he *wouldn't* be the one ruling? How does *that* make sense for him? Even weird little things like the vat of Snokes completely undermines himself, and it wasn't even necessary. He could have said he controlled Snoke like a puppet and everyone would assume he was just behind the scenes because that's what he does. By having that vat it suddenly opens up a bunch of weird questions. And just to have something cool in the background because you can't think of anything else?

Ultimately it's a shame that they didn't plan things out. When Rian killed off Snoke he expected a creative answer to how to redeem Kylo, but J.J. just isn't that type of writer, and instead fell back to what he knows. I believe that J.J. knows how to make fun movies and is great for summer blockbusters. Wide and pretty, but shallow. Star Wars is supposed to be something that's shallow and fun as well as deep, it's always been something for everyone, but I think J.J. sort of misses the point a bit. The movies are fun, but they don't really have things you can dive deep into like you can with the OT and PT.
