>This can happen in literally ANY scifi franchise with faster than light travel: Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate, Battlestar, Halo, Farscape, whatever. In any of them you can ask the question, "well why can't they smash a ship into it really quickly?" Hell you can ask that question in fucking Firefly and they're not even FTL capable because interplanetary speeds in that show are good enough to ruin a planet.

I 100% agree it is a real question to ask all of those series, and all of those series can give an answer and I would be satisfied with it. TLJ is not galaxy breaking because it did something it didn't give an answer to, it is galaxy breaking because it did something that up until this point no on had done and if it could be done it 1000000% would have been done because it is so extremely OP and so extremely easy to do. It is galaxy breaking because it breaks the rules of the rest of the series.
