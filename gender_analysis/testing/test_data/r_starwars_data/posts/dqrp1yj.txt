KotOR II actually has a very good, if cynical, conversation about this. The Sith try to be free above all else ("Through victory my chains are broken"), but inevitably become slaves to the Dark Side and their ambition and are never actually able to achieve the goal that they turned to the Dark Side for, so the freedom that the Dark Side promises is a lie. 


The Jedi reject this freedom, and teach all their students to repress want and emotion, but inevitably there are going to be people unwilling to let go of emotions, especially as they travel the galaxy and see joy and suffering in the lives of other people, and as acting on their emotion would be a betrayal of the Jedi Code, the only way for them to embrace the new-found world of emotion they gain access to is to betray the Order, and furthermore, since they were never trained to deal with emotions, only to repress them, as well as their social conditioning that breaking the code leads to the dark side, a disproportionate number of Jedi fall. The Jedi Code is a lie, because it forces Jedi into a win/lose, light/dark dichotomy, that doesn't truly exist.

Grey Jedi are not mentioned much in the game, but it is implied that their philosophy is little better than what the Sith and the Jedi preach.
