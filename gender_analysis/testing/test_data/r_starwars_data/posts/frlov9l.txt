Personally, the idea that you have to be born to power has always been one my least favorite fantasy tropes and has nothing to do with Disney.  Im not the other guy so i dont presume to speak for them but it just feels so lazy and weak to me.  Also, whether intentional by the author or otherwise, there is a clear subtext in that idea that unless you have the correct dna youre destined for mediocrity at best and can never hope to change the world.  For a genre that seems to promote hope an awful lot that comes across incredibly dispairing.
