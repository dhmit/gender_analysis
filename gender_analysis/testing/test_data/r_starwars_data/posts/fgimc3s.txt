As far as I understood it, the crystal needs to be awakened by a Force sensitive. This is also why so many dark Jedi use red; when they need a new crystal, apparently there must be some connection made between the user and the crystal in order to "activate" it. However, dark Jedi don't usually form these connections and instead use the Force to bend a crystal to their will.
