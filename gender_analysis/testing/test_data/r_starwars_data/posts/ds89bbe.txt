Yeah alright, it came across that way but maybe I was overly sensitive because so much of the SW fan base is just, not sure what word to use.

I still disagree, but that's fine.  Even if the issue is that shields absorb a lot the impact meaning only a cruiser sized object would work, you could still strap an asteroid to a hyperdrive, or just do it without them expecting it (when not in battle etc).

But who knows, maybe there is an explanation that would work.  Id love to hear it.  Like I said before it didn't make the movie bad and it wasn't until much later when suspension of disbelief wore off that I started to nitpick a couple things, this being one of them.

For the record I fucking loved it.  ;-)
