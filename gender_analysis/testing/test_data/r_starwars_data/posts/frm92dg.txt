It was heavily implied via TFA and TLJ that the force was rebounding from Sidious's actions. I genuinely believed that Finn and Poe were going to both be revealed to be force sensitive, though maybe not set up to become Jedi. I mean, Poe had Anakin-level pilot skills and Finn went toe to toe with Kylo for a while. 

I know that TLJ is divisive (and I really don't want to start a debate about that) but I felt like it built on those things, especially at the end - the force had 'awoken.'  I don't think TROS managed to capture any of that, so I suppose it's moot anyway.
