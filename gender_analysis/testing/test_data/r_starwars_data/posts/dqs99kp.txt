The Jedi purpose is to get the personality out of the way and be an empty vessel for the Force to do its will. It emphasizes compassion, healing, nonviolence, and connection.

The Sith way is to embrace rage and hatred and selfish lust, and to show no mercy.

Regardless of whatever edgy nonsense the new movies introduce obout "grey Jedi" or whatever, 

If the choice is ever between the Jedi path or the dark path,

I believe in the way of the Jedi. I daresay it's even been important in helping me form my own personal credo throughout my life.

May the Force be with you.
