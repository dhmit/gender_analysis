>4-6 were thrown together far more than people realize, too. Lucas had some idea of what was going to happen after New Hope, but the extent to which he had it planned out is overblown. And really watching with a critical eye, you see how the seams -

>7-9 are always going to be such a disappointment. Such a missed opportunity. Not the biggest JJ fan, but they should have just given him all 3. If it's a trilogy, it needs one story guy.


That made SUCH a huge difference though. I really feel like 9 wouldn't have been *as* jarring if JJ had control of it. If he had and had at least teased Palps and some of the other shit that was just "oh hey, this is a thing now, accept it because you're a fan" the movie would have played out a lot better and been more accessible to the fans. The three movies really feel like you took 7,8,9 and then a separate trilogy with the same characters and made a sandwich but used some minor plot points as glue/condiments.
