So the Force has a will, it strives for equilibrium, balance, harmony. Not equal amounts of light and dark, or done grey state of natural order and like most idiot gods (H.P Lovecraft) doesn’t see nuance. So one explanation for all of the Force sensitive storm troopers might be that the force corralled them together in the same platoon/battalion for some reason yet unknown to us. 


I dunno, I’m just trying to make sense of JJs horrible storytelling so it doesn’t ruin it for me.
