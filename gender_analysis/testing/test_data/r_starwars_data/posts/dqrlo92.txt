Luke was a fluke.

It also helped that he had very little to be connected to, and he *still* almost fucked it up.

Firstly, he didn't seem as devotedly connected to his Aunt and Uncle. I don't mean he hated them or anything, but compared to the bonding under pressure that Anakin had with his mother due to their slave status, it was a more mundane upbringing.

Then they died, pretty much immediately. So that kind of soured him on connecting to people a little. Loss is one very quick way to learn that, as long as you don't think you're powerful enough to do much about it. Instead of being spurred to action, it just hurts.

But it's okay! He starts to slowly pivot his connections towards Obi-Wan Kenobi. This guy is cool, exciting, and he's gonna teach the ways of the For... no, wait. He's *also* dead.

At this point, Luke is becoming a little hardened regarding this kind of thing. He's not all of the way there yet, but it's starting to leave a mark.

So he eventually ends up on Dagobah, with the most traditionalist Jedi teacher there could be. Yoda *specifically* lectures him on being too attached (probably not a bad lesson to reiterate to a Skywalker).

But he *still* fails, because he leaves his training early because he feels Leia is in trouble. So he does his very best to fuck things up by being too attached as well. Lucky for him, it only costs him a hand.

*Now* Luke is done with this bullshit. He may still have people that matter to him, but maintaining emotional distance is finally important to him. The Emperor *almost* gets him to fuck this up one last time; by needling him over how his friends are all about to die, it's how he gets Luke to finally try and kill him. Vader musing about turning Leia sets Luke onto him with a vengeance.

It isn't until he sees Vader's electronic bits, and he looks at his own electronic hand, that he realizes he's about to repeat his father's mistakes. Both suffered hard because they couldn't make impartial decisions. And then we get the iconic line, "I am a Jedi, like my father before me". It is that moment when Luke finally cuts loose.

Luke's battle with attachment is one of the major conflicts he faces in the original trilogy. And given what may be coming in the new trilogy, it's looking very likely that he didn't actually fully overcome that Skywalker weakness after all.

The other thing is that not only was Luke a bit stronger against it, Anakin was *weak* against attachments due to being naturally fearful. When something threatened those he loved, he would become deeply afraid of what would happen to them. And fear leads to anger...
