Agreed. Until recently, I always thought a force sensitive, or even a minor force user, could go their entire lives without developing if they never were shown the ways. Kinda like, if qui gon didnâ€™t land on tattoine, anakin might have just grown up being a really good pod racer and mechanic. And I always liked the way that sounded. But now we got highly advanced force techniques sprouting up as if they are a common and casual event.
