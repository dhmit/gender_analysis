The scene also undermines Lukes character development.

In the opening of TESB we see Luke surprised and captured by a wampa. Using his skill in the force and his courage, he is able to just barely defeat this mysterious and terrifying  monster from the strange ice planet Hoth. This scene is used to show us that Luke has progressed from the naive farm boy in Episode IV. 

This scene with C-3PO changes audience perceptions of wampa's, they're now some kind of wacky pets the Rebels keep in a spare room in their base, the only safety precaution is a yellow sticker.

Luke barely survived his encounter with a Wampa, making wampas seem silly or funny, makes Lukes victory less meaningful.
