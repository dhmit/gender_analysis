Help me out here.....nurses came from the hospital WITH the 2 kids to get a refund (to fund the kid's flights back home) AND they decided to tour Disney even though they just saw their mom died?

That all sounds weird. Why did they have to take the 2 girls with them? I'm assuming it was probably days that had passed, right?
