After Star Trek: TMP failed, Gene Roddenberry was booted to Executive Producer but basically all he could do was send angry memos about how he disagreed with whatever they were planning to do in the movies. He apparently kept pitching a time travel story where Kirk tries to stop the Kennedy assassination over and over again. He did have more input into TNG when it started, though.
