It really showed that they didnâ€™t have a complete overarching story for the trilogy from the get go.  It felt like with each new movie they were essentially winging it as far as the story goes.  There should have been a 3 movie plan laid out for each of the movies and every character from the beginning, otherwise you end up with this.  A jumbled mess with terrible character development.
