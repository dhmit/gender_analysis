She lived her entire live on a junk planet, scrapping ships from the exact same era as the Millenium Falcon. I think it’s natural that she knows how to fly it. And even then she struggles really hard. She has trained her entire life fighting people with a stick. I do sword fighting as a hobby, and I’m pretty convinced that fighting with a stick isn’t that different from a sword if you understand the basics. The reason she beats Kylo Ren is because, first of all Kylo Ren wasn’t training from a young age but more like the age of 17 so there you are wrong but he got shot with a fucking Wookie bowcaster. Have you not seen in the movie how insanely powerful those things are? In episode 2, when Anakin and Obi-Wan fight Dooku, why do they just give up? It’s showen in both TCW and Fallen Order that you can still fight after loosing a limb. 


That+ the fact that Kylo just killed his father witch is a major struggling point for him during the entire trilogy and the first point about Rey and I think it becomes clear that it’s natural that Rey was able to beat Kylo Ren in that fight. And yet again, she still struggles. What are you even talking about that she does it with “no problems” cause she very clearly has struggles with it. 

You give 2 examples and they aren’t even good ones. Give me some more examples because she isn’t a Marry Sue. Everything she does is just as believable as any other Star Wars character we’ve seen so far. 

And I’m sorry but you can’t call people idiots for having a different opinion/view on something. If you do, then you’re the idiot yourself.
