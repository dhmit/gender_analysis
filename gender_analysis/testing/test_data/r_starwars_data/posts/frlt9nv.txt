I mean, not necessarily. By that logic every Jedi should’ve felt the Clone’s betrayal, but we only see really powerful force users responding to it. ANH implies that every one can use the force if they believe in it and (iirc) TPM kind of establishes that everyone has the force, but your midiclorian count determines how much of it you can use. Like a low midiclorian count means that with concentration you can hit an impossible bullseye or run really fast, but with a high count you can effortlessly pull off feats like the Jedi do.
