That’s how I felt with Phasma. I was watching RoS waiting for her to surface. Could have been a perfect catalyst to start the stormtrooper insurrection. She gives some order to slaughter a bunch of innocents on a planet that the rebels are hiding out on. Stormtroopers all give her the finger and bob’s your uncle.
