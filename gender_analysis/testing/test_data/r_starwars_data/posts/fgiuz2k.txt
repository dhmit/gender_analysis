If Rian Johnson didnt spend most of the movie trying to destroy perception, subvert expectations, and rewrite what came before, people wouldnt be calling it the "let the past die" movie. People understand that you dont take a villain at their word. But the overall feel of the movie was very much "let the past die", even if "but learn from it" was tossed in toward the end. Theres a reason so many people see this movie this way, but dont think the point of other movies is to give in to hatred and fear, and to join the dark side.
