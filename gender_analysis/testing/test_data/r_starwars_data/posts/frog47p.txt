While in general, he could have been more, I actually really liked that he wasn't a Jedi as it made his arc in TFA really satisfying. By the end of the film he takes on a Sith Lord with a weapon he has no idea how to use, without any confidence the gift of the force might provide. 

That's called courage, it contrasted Rey's "anybody can be special" with "anybody can become a hero" and to me was the more compelling of the two arcs.
