I don't think he'd need to be a Jedi at the end. He could have learned to use the force but chosen deliberately not to try and become a Jedi and follow the old ways.

Ray could still become a Skywalker and a Jedi but she could be a different kind of Jedi that doesn't believe there has to be a "do it my way or the dark side will take you" dichotomy.

And it would be really cool to see someone fighting using force powers and making it work with weapons besides lightsabers. Like imagine sniping with a blaster and using the force to curve the shot or split the projectile.
