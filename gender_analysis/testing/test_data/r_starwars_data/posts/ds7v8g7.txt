I re watched rouge one on Netflix and I paid real close attention to this scene. When Tarkin orders the weapon to fire he says something like "set one rotation" or something like that which indicated to me ATLEAST you can set the power level or destruction level meaning the blast can be as "small" as a nuclear blast (scarif) or as catastrophic as Jedha or as world ending as Alderaan
