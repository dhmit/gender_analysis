Being a Jedi was not an option. The only Jedi left at that point was Luke, that we know of. Look at the 2nd movie title. 

What does being a Jedi even mean? Using the force and using a lightsaber?

Or being a Padawan then moving up the ranks in the order that did not exist. 

There are so many bullshit plot points to pick at but this one is lazy. Rey was never a Jedi.
