I must be in the minority here, but I liked what Finn was? Obviously him being a Jedi would be sweet, because Jedi are sweet, but I liked him being clearly force sensitive but also not a Jedi. it could have been developed better from the start (like most things in the new trilogy) but it was a new character type that we haven't had and I liked that. Like most things people complain about in the new trilogy, they didn't get exactly what they expected so they don't like it.
