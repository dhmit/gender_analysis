Well thanks to Project Stardust, the Empire managed to figure out that Kyber Crystals could be used (without the aid of the Force) for other purposes. Yeah, you may not be able to build a lightsaber out of them, but they're still very powerful magic space diamonds, which make for great planet destroying laser beams. It takes the Force to figure out if that particular crystal is aligned with a Force user, but it only takes a little bit of chemistry to figure out which rocks are Kyber Crystals, and which aren't.
