Learned this word from my dads deep love of this book. He told me *a nerdy preteen* he would buy me all the books I could carry if I would read on of his favorites. I did, but hated the main character so much that I refused to finish it. Years later dad finds this out and is appalled, "you didn't finish it?? You HAVE to finish it!!!" 

He was right. 

[[Though I do have to say I always thought it meant in totality. Like, I know how a TV works because buttons, but idk how it WORKS, like each piece in relation to another. I always thought this fullness of comprehension was "to grok".]]
