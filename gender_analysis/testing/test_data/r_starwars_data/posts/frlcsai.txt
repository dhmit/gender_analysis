Don't worry, most of the actors and actresses introduced to the franchise in these soulless cash-grabs disguised as films is going to do very well post series (except Oscar Isaac who is going to be in every Alex Garland flick until the end of time). I would be happy to see Boyega in other things with a bit more depth, admittedly in part because I like to say his name, but it's going to take something special for him to break out of the Finn pit.

Making Finn a Jedi or rearranging things to put him more center-stage wouldn't have fixed the sloppy story-telling. In that sense, it may be a blessing in disguise for him (as an actor) long term. Daisy Ridley is always going to be Rey motherfucking *Skywalker*.
