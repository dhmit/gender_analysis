If you have Amazon Prime I'd highly recommend going back & watching The Batman Animated Series (1992) and select animated films he is in.                 While the series was before my time I went back & gave it a watch some of the finest childrens animation I've seen.                  I'm quick to rank it with Avatar: The Last Airbender & Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) honestly!              







If you're still taking suggestions do make watching Heart of Ice (Series 1, Episode 3) a priority.                 According to research I've done on the series the episode was so well produced it laid the groundwork for Mr. Freeze from that point out & it really shows!
