I mean, werent non jedi force users rare because the jedi would go out and find literally anyone who was force sensitive and basically abduct them? Its be weirder if there weren't random force sensitive out there now that they weren't being recruited as children. 

Also learning techniques as you need them is just normal in universe, luke learnt pulling his lightsaber as soon as he needed it, or redirecting starfighter blasts, anakin never had his training shown in the movies. It seems like training is more to learn to use the forces more niche abilities, but whenever you need an ability you will just use it.

But as far as lukes training was shown, it was basically force trust exercises, so that they know to just have faith and try.

Maybe the TV shows are different, but thats my take based on the movies, where using the force is more of a gut feeling than a thing you study and master, the skill is more on the lightsaber side of being a jedi.
