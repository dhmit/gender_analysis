Being force sensitive will still have an effect of your life without training, you just need training to manifest the powerful force techniques of the Jedi/sith. To the untrained eye they just seem like a lucky individual, but they may also get nonspecific feelings of dread before disasters and strong sensitivities may even have vague premonitions in their dreams.

Also, without the Jedi kidnapping every force user they can find they'll be more mixed in with the general population.

My biggest gripe is your second point, this trilogy has such an insane power creep among the main characters.
