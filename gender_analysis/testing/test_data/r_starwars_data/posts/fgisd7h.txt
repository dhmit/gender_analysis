That's not necessarily true. Kylo Ren was the villain, yes, and a lot of what he said was wrong â€“ but that doesn't that there can't be kernels of truth in what he said. It's down to individual viewers to decide if they want to agree or disagree with the "Let the past die," lines, and I personally agreed with them. Not by his *methods* of killing everyone, of course, but I absolutely agreed with the sentiment.
