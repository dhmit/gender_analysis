>Johnson took everything TFA was setting up and did the complete opposite to divert expectations, that's just a terrible way to continue a story. 

You would have been correct in most contexts, but this isn't most contexts. This is a director spending the entire first third of a sequel on copying the original series. Not only was subverting expectations logical, it was the only option available.

Or what, did you want to see a complete copy of the original trilogy?
