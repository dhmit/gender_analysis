I was actually fine with him not being a Jedi. I thought that was a nice subversion. But the follow through with how they handled Rey's character and her backstory was shit. They really did her a disservice but not making her earn any of her powers and whatnot. And as far as Finn, they could've humanized the troopers further and had an entire arc for him around that whole aspect, but nah. The whole thing was a mess. It would've been better if they'd just left it be.

At this point I don't want them making any more star wars movies related to the Skywalker saga. There's plenty of other lore in the Star Wars universe they can pull from. But even then, I'd prefer they create brand new franchises and take risk with new and hungry writers/directors and their stories. Star Wars wouldn't be Star Wars if people didn't greenlight a movie about space wizards and dudes with no aim wearing ridiculously clunky white armor led by another dude who uses a freaking laser sword against blasters.
