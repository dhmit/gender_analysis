I always wondered if the mass amount of new force sensitives was two fold,

One - all the jedi died. There was an old thought that the force was stronger when a jedi died, as they were then connected with the force. This could be the reasoning behind the search to maintain consciousness after death in the clone wars animated series by Yoda. But I'll digress and move on. 

Two - the potential for the number of force sensitives could be a limited thing, but with the mass deaths, and the lack of anyone finding these people and training them, (10000 jedi died in the purge presumably per Rebels at least) that would be a large number of potential force sensitives. 

Eh. That's at least how I think about it.

Edit- Afterthought - all beings are sensitive to the force, the question is to what extent - source Rebels - animals can be more sensitive to it than people in some cases. When the mass death happened, the force potentially grew with all of the life forms contributing their living energy back to the cosmic force. (Different kinds of "force" being living and cosmic, if I remember correctly. Source TCW episode with the Father, Sister, and Brother.)

Main point which the above post attempts to provide evidence for - Mass genocide of force sensitives caused mass amount of new force sensitives.
