It still sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Hyperspace Ramming sounds a lot like mutually assured destruction. If one side starts using this as a weapon to incur Mass murder, then the other side will start using it. Which results in EVERYONE dead. No one wants everyone dead on both sides. 

Just like nuclear weapons in real life. Yeah, we could send a million soldiers into Russia in wintertime. But it would be a lot easier if we just nuked them. If we did nuke them, then they nuke us back then both of us are all dead. We don't nuke eachother irl because of the mutual understanding that using them means that we all die. No one wants everyone dead. 

Personally I think the Vice Admiral FUCKED up. That was not a smart move in the long run. The only thing that probably saved the free citizens of the galaxy from being obliterated from hyperspace, is that Kylo Ren doesn't strike me as the type to use that type of tactic. He seems more of the stright forward "literally punch you in the face until you submit, then another for good measure" kinda guy.
