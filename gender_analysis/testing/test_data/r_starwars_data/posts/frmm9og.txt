The misdirecting love interests in RoS was a whole mess. So many touching/deep scenes between most of the characters throughout the sequels which definitely came across more than platonic and then it ended anti-climatically.

-	Finn and Rey
-	Rey and Poe
-	Finn and Poe
-	Finn and Rose
-	Poe and Zorri
-	Finn and Jannah
-	Rey and Kylo

I found it so confusing/misleading watching it.
