Can someone explain why Finn - as he actually existed, not as some fans envision - is a popular character? Especially early on, I have trouble seeing why. 

When Rose first meets him, she thinks he’s trying to steal equipment in order to run away because he’s afraid of the fate awaiting them all - and she’s exactly right, that is what he’s doing. And yes, his background as a stormtrooper and initial escape is harrowing, but ALL he tried to do was escape, not fight back against them. 

If he were a real person with that experience we’d all think “no problem, of course you’d escape if you can, no one’s obliged to be a hero”. But then why do we treat him like a hero?
