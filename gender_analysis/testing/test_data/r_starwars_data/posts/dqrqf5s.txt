I can see your argument but one could argue that Anakin's breaking of the love rule is what turned him to the dark side.  I believe the Jedi have the rule not to marry because Jedi's are supposed to be bad ass and, because marriage destroys all things good, you make the vow and all that bad-ass-ness goes away.  You can't compete with the dark side, you drop out of the council and you end up owning a parts kiosk on Tattoine in debt and resenting your partner.  I mean.... that's just a theory and this is all obviously fiction and *sob* someone get me off this deserted rock!!!!11!!!!
