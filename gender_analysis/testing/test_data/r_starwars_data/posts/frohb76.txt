Yeah honestly my biggest critique of TLJ was the handling of Finn. He already went through the same arc in TFA, I cannot fathom how on earth they thought it was a good idea to make him repeat it. Plus the whole thing where they had to show him how "war is bad" as if he didn't see that right at the start of TFA lmao
