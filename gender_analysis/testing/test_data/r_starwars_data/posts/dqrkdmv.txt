I worked at a very popular shoe company's call center and Mark would sometimes call and act like the joker over the phone and order the shoes. In one of our large meetings with a client we showed the recording and it was hilarious, he asked the manager if she wanted to send him her address and he would send some star wars autographed stuff. Truly can do no wrong.
