Marvel has already tried the way of adding more and more superheros each movie. So they have already started to kill them off, otherwise they would only interfere with each other and join in all kinds of aliances against of each other. 

In the sequel trilogy, Lucasfilms tried to go another way, focusing on "normal people" fighting along with superheroes and contributing to the overall success of their mission. Somewhat similar what Warner Bros. did in Bladerunner 2049.

And I like this approach more, because, well I'm not a Jedi and neither can nor want to become one. But I'm normal guy and it is easier for me to become attached to Finn, Bodhi Rook (the pilot from Rogue One) or even Rose.
