One funny part is that EA's karma increased because of the comment.

"Why?" you ask. Because after a small number of  downvotes on a comment  Reddit  stops any more of those downvotes affecting your score. So when the EA comment became so famous that people kept voting and voting, the  600,000+ downvotes weren't counting, but the small percentage of upvotes were continually getting added to their karma, giving them a 10,000+ increase in their karma.
