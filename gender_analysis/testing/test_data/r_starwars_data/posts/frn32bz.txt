That's how stupid the movie is, Finn should have died against Kylo. No fucking way some random ass stormtrooper can take down a trained Jedi/Sith, especially since he has no experience handling a lightsaber. His back should have been split wide open, lightsabers are nothing more than glowing swords now.
