None of that has any bearing on the film though. Cut out Canto Bight and you lose nothing. If Finn and Rose had stayed in the Resistance ship, they would have missed minimal character development but the plot would have flowed exactly the same. 

Also, the Canto kid scene is pointless. The Force was never a thing reserved for bloodlines. The Jedi don't procreate, their order is literally founded on the principle of children volunteered by their parents across the galaxy. The Jedi would find some random force-sensitive kid, train him, and bam. The Skywalkers was the first mention of a force-sensitive bloodline, so it's more the exception than the rule. 

I do agree that the Palpatine crap was garbage, but TLJ is just plain trash. It's pointless, it's tepid, the arcs are boring and have no impact, and it ignores a tremendous amount of lore to make vapid points that weren't even followed up on.
