Interesting point on Boba Fett! I think the historical marketing context makes that even better. Boba Fett was also hyped up by marketing with merchandise and appearences in the holiday special (lol) and I'd imagine that people were pretty disappointed in his relatively tiny part in Empire, back in the day. The iconography and popularity of Boba Fett today, depsite his character having such a minor role, can be traced back to a marketing campaign before Empire. Crazy how well that worked.
