I kind of disagree. The more it progressed the more it felt like what it was supposed to be. I actually didn’t like the first film because it felt like a cheapened version of Last Hope. There were topics raised in the first film I would have liked to see explained more, but I think the first film was essentially just filler while they were still developing the main character. Once Rey grew into her role, they abandoned the other topics. In the end I believe Finn’s significance was to show a broader point that the Jedi race was re-emerging. Finn was the first representation of this, and at the end of the Trilogy they reiterate this point by showing a random child using the Force. Finn was significant BECAUSE he is not the only one. The Jedi live on. And yeah, they could have let him have a glory moment of killing himself off to save the group.. but instead of being another cliche he saved the group AND survived to the happy ending - embodying the ultimate journey of the trilogy. Finn was essentially a 2nd main and if they had put anymore emphasis on that it would have completely undermined the Rey narrative because he was a much stronger character.

Edit: I also got the impression that the end of the trilogy was a setup for a star wars series featuring Finn and the others. I would be surprised if we don’t see more develop from this..
