Well i didnt choose that, George Lucas did. Obi Wan literally says “the force can be used to influence the weak minded” he says that in reference to stormtroopers. So logically, stormtroopers are weak minded. And also, weak minded beings cant use the force. Ergo, stormtroopers cant be force sensitive.
