> they did stand for balance

Except... did they?

There are two sides of the Force. If there were balance there would have been an equal number of light and dark side users, **or** the Jedi themselves would have used both the dark and light side and found balance within themselves.

Instead the spent thousands of years hunting down and killing Force users who followed the dark side. They also basically forbade their own followers from studying the dark side openly, and generally punished or killed those Jedi that did so.

That isn't balance, that is borderline genocide.

Darth Vader was the person prophesied to bring balance to the Force and really his sole reason for existing was to kill as many light side users as possible so that the dark side would have a chance to compete in the universe again.
