Except that no one in the film learns from their failures, least of all Luke, who clearly forgot his first conversation with Obi Wan in ANH, where he was told that the Jedi had ruled the Galaxy "for a thousand generations." 

The Jedi were EXTREMELY successful. Luke fucked up one time (off screen, mind you) and he's all the sudden like, "Nope! It doesn't work! The system that worked for 25,000 years got it 100% wrong!"

It's terrible writing.
