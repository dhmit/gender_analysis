I still think every jedi had a side piece and no one ever clued in Anakin that it was one of those rules that they preach to the younglings super hard and then immediately ignore when the kid hits puberty. Anakin is freaking the fuck out because jedi aren't supposed to have attachments, but if he had just told someone, they'd have been like, "And? Just send your kids to daycare dude. Padme's a senator, y'all can afford it. What's the problem?"
