I think a main character explained that the Force brings Force users together, that things are coincidences, but the Force acting or guiding them.

If you look at Ep1-3 + the CW you see that there are a lot of Jedi going through training, a people that were former Jedi (Count D.), different concepts of the Force (Witches), and people unaware of the Force and never know of or find their way to the Jedi.   

All of those together could indicate that Force sensitivity is more common than we expect and exists on a spectrum where one may only feel their connection to the Force, all the way to where one *is* the Force.

There could be someone/thing that only uses the Force to make others think its farts do/donâ€™t stink.
