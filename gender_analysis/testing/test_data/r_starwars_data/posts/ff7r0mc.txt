I have note 8, was 1000, it's the best phone ever and I've had it for 2 years, will have it for another 3 I hope at least. I actually just got a whole new refurb phone with brand new everything because my charging port had food in it from work overtime in food industry. So ya I believe I'll get another 4 years of I'm lucky and it wins far worth 1000 if its gona last me 6 years.
