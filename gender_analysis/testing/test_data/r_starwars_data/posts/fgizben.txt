Uhhh did you hear all they were talking about during the build up to that? It was never that serious, especially for the start of a movie, they keep talking about “that business on nemoidia doesn’t count” or something like that, it’s clearly a very light mood and they don’t feel too much pressure
Same then when R2 sends the elevator the wrong way, they didn’t get too mad at him, because it wasn’t as serious as you’re making it, or they had it under control. 
They started with humor to get to the real drama of him killing kids and fighting his best friend. The beginning was literally supposed to be slapstick to contrast the heaviness of the rest of the movie
