I feel like a lot of the dead ends/missed plot lines people point out are probably the fault of the wonky production: only 2 years between movies, back-and-forth between directors, and not enough planning. 3-year gaps and a rough outline for the trilogy could’ve worked better and allowed for stuff like Finn’s arc to be fleshed out some more, even with completely different directors
