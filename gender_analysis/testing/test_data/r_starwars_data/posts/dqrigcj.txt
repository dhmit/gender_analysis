I could recant and say that while yes being passive and neutral is wrong, they did stand for balance and even though not “good” they stood between evil and people who deserved it. 

I don’t like the Jedi tenets because it pushes potentially good Jedi to the dark side. Emotional? Only way to express your emotions is to join the dark side.  On a side note Window was quite “on the line” for a Jedi. I always muse myself that’s why he had a purple light saber. Red and Blue. But I know that’s not why. 

If anakin could simply have a wife and family, he wouldn’t have ever become Vader. (If he got help from the Jedi instead of Palpatine but he would have been rebuked.)

The only argument I find to this is like, emotions can sometimes cause you to do stupid shit.
