A lot of the problems with the last film (though I didn’t find it bad overall) were things that could’ve been fixed with just one or two line changes, which infuriated me. This plus, why not just have a proper resounding line from Hayden Christensen inspiring Rey to fight back? The prophecy would be upheld and Anakin saves the galaxy, just by acting through an equally strong-spirited warrior. How hard would that have been?
