I agree with this 100% and have been saying this for a while. Finn genuinely had the most interesting initial  backstory. It wouldâ€™ve been amazing to see the character start out as a reject stormtrooper and rise to the rank of Jedi Knight throughout the span of a trilogy but nah.

It also sucks because John Boyega is actually a pretty decent actor as well.
