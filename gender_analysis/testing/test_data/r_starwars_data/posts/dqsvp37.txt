Several fundamental flaws here.

The Dark side **is** evil. It is something you can physically perceive, even without being force sensitive. It is why Sith world's like Ziost are basically abandoned except for scum. 

The Force isn't a tool like a blaster. It is alive. Using it for evil corrupts it and creates the Dark side. Even more importantly it corrupts you. Using the Dark Side has very real, very tangible consequences.

The Jedi doesn't take children, the families give them up willingly. And it is the better option to train them from a young age.

Dark side powers are pretty much all harmful and evil. Force Lightning made of pure hatred and pain, choking, destroying minds, etc. Mind tricks are basically little influences, not direct control.

The means and the ends are what make the Sith evil. The means used by the Jedi are not even comparable.


Also any examples of these non-babykilling sith?
