It's not inconsistent because nobody has ever said you can't do that. Throw some line of dialogue into an EU comic about how it takes a lot of mass to do any real damage to a Star Destroyer at lightspeed and it's economically unfeasible to constantly sacrifice large ships when the enemy fleet is so much larger than that of the rebels. Couple of retconned stories of fighters doing it in the past for good measure. Boom problem solved. 

That's the great thing about fantasy universes, you can just make shit up to solve discrepancies. We've been doing it for decades.
