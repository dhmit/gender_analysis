This has always confused me. I have played hundreds of games where Iâ€™ve had to work to unlock new characters, weapons etc. This was sort of expected and did genuinely create a sense of pride upon unlocking it. I know the system was bad but surely unlocking things in games is an elementary part of gaming?
