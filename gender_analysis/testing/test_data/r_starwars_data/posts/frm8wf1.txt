Literally. Finn has been captured, final words he tells them how Phasma got starkiller destroyed.

Platoon turns on her, she takes out A TON of them so we actually see her do something. She duels with Finn again, this time Finn loses, but before she can kill him, a stormtrooper kills Phasma, takes off the helmet and the trooper is Jannah. Boom done.

Finn and Jannah on Exegol take the troops, storm Pryde's ship and bridge. Finn kills Pryde with Phasma's blaster, boom.
