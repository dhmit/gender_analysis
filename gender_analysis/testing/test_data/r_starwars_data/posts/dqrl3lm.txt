Can Mark Hamill be president? Like seriously, if we have current politicians being the way they are now, how is he worse?

"Well he's not qualified."
And the current one is?

Hamill is at least compassionate and wants to bring positivity to the world. He also strikes me as the kind of guy to be humble enough to know he doesn't know everything, and would surround himself with people that are very qualified for an administration's positions.

Honestly, I would take a kind and humble person as president over an experienced career politician who's a sellout any day.
