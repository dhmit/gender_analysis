According to the voice actor community he's a 100% professional class act. Working with him bringing energy and positivity to the whole project. Not just good but fun to work with.  

Plus the dude has range and is one of the few that can turn their signature voice on or off. It took me three years to notice Hamill was on Regular Show. To SW fan's he's luke, but to animation fans, there's him and there's Mel Blanc.
