I actually think there could have been something done with they idea that Rey was actually a nobody. I don't really like The Last Jedi as a Star Wars movie or as a movie in general, but I thought the idea that *anyone* could be force sensitive was a good theme that unfortunately was not capitalized upon. In fact, there could have been a tie to TFA in that the Force had awakened in so many people -more people at once than ever before. And because of the efforts of the Emperor, no one knew what the Force was.
