You know this would’ve been cool. But you know what I just realized that is absolute bullshit?

**”Aren’t you a little short to be a Storm Trooper?”** - Princess Leia

John Boyega’s height: 5’9”

Mark Hamill’s height: 5’9”

Damn it Leia! Luke is the height of a Storm Trooper! Not all of the Storm Troopers are Clones!!!

*ahem

Sorry about that. It would’ve been real cool to see Luke have done that or any Jedi for that matter, especially during the Purge.
