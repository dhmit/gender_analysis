LA is actually a subtractor for a Hell-based vehicular torture provider. Hell had been spending a lot of money for on-premesis vehicular torture when they found they could outsource for a tiny fraction of the cost. LA's vision of the future is Vehicular-Torture-as-a-Service (VTaaS). They already have some test deployments in the Inland Empire and Santa Clarita.
