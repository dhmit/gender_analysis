I personally think producing excessive amount of hard plastic is a waste it doesnt matter if you store it or not. Lego is mostly made from crude oil only a small percentage is made from sugarcanes but they are trying to go full sustainable by 2030 if I read it right(which is great). I understand this is very wholesome and you can downvote as much as you want but it doesnt change the fact that crude oil products are bad for our planet.
