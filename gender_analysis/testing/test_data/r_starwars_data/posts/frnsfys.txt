They should have focused more on Finn and had Rey be a side character. A storm trooper deserter storyline would be cool. We’ve seen the Jedi tempted by evil but overcome with good storyline too often.

Let’s chalk this up to awful writing on the prequels and sequels and hope we get good animated series focused around the sequels
