I always felt the two sides were just extremes. Not of good and evil, but of feeling. The Jedi abscond all feeling to the detriment of being able to sympathize with those that need it. Cold order and logic makes someone more akin to a robot than a human, while the Sith went too far the other way. Embracing every emotion that struck them, making them impulsive, which when paired with magic powers can lead to doing bad things. (Think of every time you got pissed at a driver. Now imagine every time you wish you could have thrown their car off the side of the road... and actually be able to do it with your mind.)
