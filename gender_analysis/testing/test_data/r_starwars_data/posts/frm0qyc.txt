He...he felt Rey die through the force, in the same manner as:

Maz Kanata (force sensitive), Leia (force user), various Jedi/Sith in comics, books, movies, tv shows, video games...they showed him having the same experience as all these people (visually).

It was strongly hinted in the movie he was force sensitive, even though it never comes out and says it.

Some force sensitives manifest in physical ways instead of "magic" force ways.  Force sensitives like Poe for example use the force to accelerate their response time and influence their "fortune".  No fancy stuff.  Still force sensitive.

And Jedi are just force sensitives (usually more powerful but not necessarily) who have learned to harness and control the force over time.

It could be his use of the force manifests like Poe's in influencing his fortune / fate to get him out of sticky situations (plenty of force sensitives / users have this perk, even some droids, though they never explained that one good enough for my tastes).

Jedi is just an organization of force users under a common banner.

And Rey, Poe, and (more than likely) Finn were a group of force users under a common banner.

Does the name really matter?
