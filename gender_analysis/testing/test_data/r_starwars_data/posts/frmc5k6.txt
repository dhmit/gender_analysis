When I watched Force Awakens, I accepted the mirroring of New Hope because I assumed it was intentional, to build up and play on nostalgia but mix it with new adventures, so that the next two movies would be free to use less nostalgia and more originality. I thought they were just “getting it out of the way”.

Boy was I wrong.
