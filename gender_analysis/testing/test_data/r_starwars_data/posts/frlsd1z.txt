Finn was always a coward that just wanted to run and survive. TFA has him leave the FO after seeing his friend die which shakes him hard. The rest of the movie is about him just trying to run away and take Rey with him since he likes her. 

TLJ continues him trying to run away but he goes on a mission cause its his only way of protecting Rey. On that mission he learns from Rose and the Hacker that there are different types of people in the galaxy. Those like the Hacker that try to remain neutral but in the end those types of people help the FO through their inaction or greed which is Finn up to this point. The Hacker even has a glimpse of a good nature to him when he gives Rose her necklace back but his betrayal shows that even a good natured neutral person still benefits the FO. Another group are those like the arms dealers or race track owners which are meant to represent the First Order through their love of war and child slavery. The final type of people are those like Rose that are willing to fight for a better world despite having no love of war as it killed her sister. 

This isn't all he learns as he then gets another lesson in the fight against Phasma where he sees the Stormtroopers she commands hesitate after learning that their leader wasn't the perfect commander they thought she was. Near the end of the movie he is fully committed to destroying the FO and taking a side rather than trying to run away. The final lesson he gets from Rose is that fighting doesn't always mean destroying the enemy but instead can be working towards protecting others. 

All of this was setting up him being the type of leader who would work towards saving those enslaved by the FO like the other brainwashed Stormtroopers and breaking their loyalty like the troopers Phasma killed. Instead TRoS decided to just go backwards on Finns character development and have him try and make a sacrifice play again to blow up a ship of enemies and spend the rest of the time only caring about Rey. TRoS should have had Finn leading the other ex Stormtroopers in leading a rebellion that takes down the main ship from the inside and saving the thousands of lives on all of the FO ships.
