I have actually thought about this quite a bit! And I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibilities. 

If the platoon was extremely close and really respected their commander (and based on what we saw that’s definitely the case) then they could have created a bond that very few could make, and thus this bond would make it so that everyone is attuned to the force because their commander is especially attuned to it.

“The Stormlight Archives” purposefully vague spoilers here (to help convey the point): >!In the Stormlight Archives, Kaladin joins “Bridge 6” and ends up uniting them in a way that no other “Bridge” could ever imagine, and everyone in that group learns to respect and trust him. Later they learn that Kaladin has special powers. Over time as those powers are developed, the other members of the group manifest powers as well, but those powers can only be used when near Kaladin.!<

This example made the Star Wars one actually very believable to me because of how well it is developed in that series.
