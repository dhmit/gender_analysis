If you watch the deleted scenes for the OT, most of them you can really tell why they decided to cut them and I can say most of the cuts were probably good decisions. But this is one of the few that I'd say would have been kind of cool as an addition. I hear that some said it didn't fit thematically or something like that and that's why it was cut.
