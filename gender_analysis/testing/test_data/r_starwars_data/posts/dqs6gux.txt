I met him when I was about 13, he was signing at a small comic shop in Hollywood called House of Secrets (named after an old horror comic). He was so amazingly friendly and open, and even came out from behind his table, gave my parents and I a huge group hug and then took our picture holding us all like family. For someone who looked up to him so much it was like a dream come true. He was also incredibly,  incredibly funny.
