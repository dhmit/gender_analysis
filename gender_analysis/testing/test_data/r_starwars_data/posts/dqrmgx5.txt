I've heard that a lot of celebrities hate when stories like this go viral because it turns into a no good deed goes unpunished kind of deal. I'll bet that if thousands see this Mark's phone'll be ringing non stop getting requests to visit sick kids. The stories that may or may not be true of Bill Gates and other uber wealthy individuals randomly paying off their waitstaff's student loans have much the same effect. I'll bet Bill has a line out the door whenever he picks a new caddy.
