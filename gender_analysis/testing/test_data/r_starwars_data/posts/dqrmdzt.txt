Not if I kill you first, weakling.

Seriously though do sharks lions or hippopotami worry about what they kill? Of course not, it's their nature. obviously we have the ability to reason and think, but didn't Palpatine reason and think his way to Galactic Emperor? Was everyone weaker than him dead or merely citizens of the Empire? Had Luke joined his father to Kill the empire, how can you say without a doubt he'd be a bad leader?

Ceasar conquered Gaul and vast swathes of Europe, Ghengis Khan killed by the hundreds of thousands but also oversaw a huge multicultural empire. Death and killing is only one aspect of a greater half that is the dark side, and to label it evil is simply ignorant.

Pretending the dark side is only evil is an absolute the Jedi adhered to that doomed them.
