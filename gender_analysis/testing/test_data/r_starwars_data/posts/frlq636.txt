If I remember correctly, in one of the old draft for episode 3 (made in the late 80s), the then differently named "Padme" would have had survived the ordeal by faking her death and disguising herself as the wet nurse for the newly adopted Leia. In is not explained what is the cause for her death later in this draft though.
