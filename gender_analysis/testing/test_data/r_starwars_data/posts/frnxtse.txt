They would all be stored securely someplace somewhere together.  It'd be impossible to reliably plan something that big otherwise.

Distributing discrete sections of the plan for contractors and Imperial suppliers across the galaxy also makes sense.  People working on life support don't need access to weapons plans, and might not be taking appropriate precautions.  Easier to steal, and then put together the big picture.

Both ideas actually make sense, and are not mutually exclusive.
