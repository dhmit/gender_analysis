I am not pissed at GL (well I am upset at him for things like Jar Jar, but that is for a different reason). The problem is not that is works or doesn't work, it doesn't work in any other series that have FLT but technically it should. Those series don't even necessarily have to give a reason that it doesn't work, it just doesn't. The reason this is galaxy breaking is not that it does work or it doesn't, it is that it apparently work now, when for all of light speed travel history (10s of thousands of years according to the old EU) it has not worked, and now all of the sudden it does with 0 explanation. Either it does work, or it doesn't and if it does work now, them something serious had to have changed (which you need to explain, because it is a serious change over how it has been done the rest of the series) or it worked previously and everyone else was just stupid not to use it.
