I’m just happy it’s over. There’s an argument to be made that there hasn’t been a good movie in the Skywalker Saga since Empire. Return of the Jedi is cool, it gets a free pass. I love it in fact. The prequels quite literally ruined my childhood, and the sequels ....... just a massive clusterfuck, with some moments of brilliance. Mainly a badly thought out leaderless shitshow. How could Kennedy let this happen? So many opportunities were missed to raise the level of storytelling. There was no cohesion, the sequels feel like three separate movies.
