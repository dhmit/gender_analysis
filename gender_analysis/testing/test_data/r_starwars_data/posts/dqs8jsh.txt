The Grey Jedi believed in Balance of the Force.  I think their code also says “There is no Dark Side, nor is there a Light Side.  There is only the Force.”  Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but I think they believed that the Force was inherently neutral; it was the Force-user that either used it for good or bad.  That’s probably why it alters the Jedi Code to include both sides of each dichotomy.
