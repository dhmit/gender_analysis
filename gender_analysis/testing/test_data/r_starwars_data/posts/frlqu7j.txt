My dream for Finn was that he would have stayed with the First Order for at least half the trilogy and we got to see him trying to hide the emerging Force. I would have loved to get more story line from the First Order and this would have been the way. Captain Phasma could have suspected that something was going on with him and spent the movies tracking him.
