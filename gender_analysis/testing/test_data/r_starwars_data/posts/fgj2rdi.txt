Lucas is an incredible world builder. The Prequels, for all their flaws, are fantastic at presenting an expanded Star Wars universe with lived in planets that are memorable. 

He just can’t stick the dialogue or the gritty bits of plot. 

Worst part of the sequels for me is how little they *feel* like Star Wars connected media, no matter how much fan service they throw in. Even The Mandalorian feels like Star Wars, so it’s not down to Lucas not directly being involved (even though Lucas helped Filoni get acquainted with SW world building for Clone Wars). 

They just feel like Hollywood films to me.
