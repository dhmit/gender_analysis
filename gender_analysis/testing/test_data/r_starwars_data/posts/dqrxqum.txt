> when i was younger i thought the jedi embodied good, and the sith embodied evil.

Well when the movies first came out the Jedi did embody good and the sith did embody evil, it was only until the prequels and the EU where the line started blurring. 

Which is good, imo. I always like when characters and factions have more human qualities, and there are very few examples of black an white "good and evil" in our world.
