I mean, even if it’s not it can still be great. Just think, special crystals with some fancy tech can make a laser sword able to cut through almost anything?? People able to manipulate objects, the minds other others, turn into ghosts able to interact with the living. Energy beams able to wipe out planets. Giant space worms able to sustain life on an asteroid. Asteroid fields aren’t actually compacted as shown. A trash beast living within a trash compactor. Stormtroopers trained from birth can’t hit their targets. A droid with wheels able to traverse the swamp of Degobah. The list can go on and on...Plenty of Star Wars is not possible or doesn’t work, but hey... its all fantasy, fun, and makes for a good story element.
