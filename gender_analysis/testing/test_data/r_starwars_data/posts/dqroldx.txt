He didn't really hate Star Wars. Lucas wanted more toys and wanted the last movie to be very kid-friendly. So, instead of killing of Han (Like Ford wanted) he kept him alive. The producer, director, and Ford all said he should die and Lucas actively refused everyone's ideas. RotJ is interesting because it's half brilliance and half crap. Ultimately though, it shows a glimmer of why the prequels ended up being bad films.
