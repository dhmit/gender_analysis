yeah the potential was lost but im still gonna enjoy the movies on some level because they are new stories in my favorite universe.  likely, ill enjoy them even more in 10 years when i watch em all again, similar to what i did with the prequels. i guess the shock of "hey wait a minute this didnt live up to what i wanted it to be in my brain" is gonna wear off and i can just be reset and watch them for what they are, star wars movies..
