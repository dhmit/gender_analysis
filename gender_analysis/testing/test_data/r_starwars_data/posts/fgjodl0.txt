OK now hear me out.  There's a swell of people that have suddenly realized that talking about Star Wars online sucks now.  And it sucks because of shit like "RUIN JOHNSON AND DISNEY HATES STAR WARS" at every fucking turn. It's just exhausting, and frankly, not even close to relevant most of the time.  It's just this incessant whining, and for a lot of us, most of that whining boils down to "I give the OT tons of leeway, and the ST absolutely no leeway".  That perspective is boring af.

You literally just whined and bitched about fucking paper.  It's pretty obvious you're not interested in actually having fun discourse about Star Wars anymore.  You've completely let your jadedness ruin the future of Star Wars for you.  That's fine, you can do that.  But other people just see that kind of thoughtless critique and decided to bury your comment.  

Don't get me wrong, we can talk about issues with the films, I'm fine with that.  All three trilogies are flawed.  But you're clearly not coming from that angle.  You're coming at it from "OH, IS THIS ANOTHER THING I CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT???".  I dunno, I guess after getting old, jaded people just seem so transparent to me.
