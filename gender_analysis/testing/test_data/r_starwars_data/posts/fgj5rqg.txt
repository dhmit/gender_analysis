In Legends, space flight was a thing for at least 160,000 years before the Jedi were formed, Coruscant was multi-tiered for 50,000 years prior as well. Iâ€™d say there was a fair chance that paper was outdated by millennia by the time the Jedi Order started. 

The solution is of course to ignore non-canon Legends stuff, as Disney does, but it would just be nice if they at least acknowledged ancient history as still being far and above what we have now
