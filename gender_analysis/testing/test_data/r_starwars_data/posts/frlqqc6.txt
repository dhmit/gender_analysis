The trilogy even opened with him. They sit there and have a cool narrative of a Stormtrooper defecting and wanting to be anywhere but where the First Order is attacking because he knows how strong they are, but instead stands up to try to protect the people. Along the way he could have discovered that while he may not have the force or at least he isn't strong with it, he can still fight because you don't have to be a mystical space wizard to do the right thing. You can just be that person that says "Enough".

Isn't that a better message than only a chosen few can be heroes?
