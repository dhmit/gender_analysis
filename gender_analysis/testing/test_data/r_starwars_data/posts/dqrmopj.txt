I somewhat agree actually. I don't know about saying *ever* though. History shows us that nothing, good or bad, lasts forever. It's cyclical. Evil men have always oppressed people. But evil men have often pushed so hard that a backlash had forced them to run and hide elsewhere in the world, or actually killed them. The question is just when is the pressure too much and causes that backlash. Bloody revolutions aren't new. I hope we don't experience one though.
