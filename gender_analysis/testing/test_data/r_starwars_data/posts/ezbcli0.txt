I like how that comment has 188 awards. LMFAO!!! You know damn well those we're all bought and "rewarded" by EA and not their player base. Nobody ever has 188 gold silver whatever the fuck. It's too bad they are such bastards because Battlefield is my all time favorite and it's almost embarrassing to admit anymore.
