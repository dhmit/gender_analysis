> Who's Rey? 

A random no one who lived in the galaxy's armpit and happened to be wildly force sensitive. Just like the kid at the end of TLJ who's also a random no one who lived in another of the galaxy's armpit.

> What's the First Order? Where did they come from?

Unless you expected the Yuuzhan Vong, none of this is interesting. They're the rehashed empire.
