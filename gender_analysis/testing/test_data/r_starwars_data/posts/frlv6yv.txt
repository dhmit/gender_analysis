I feel like I would have enjoyed the new trilogy more if it continued to follow Finn. But they perhaps tried too hard to make it like the original movies, making it unable to stand on its own. If Finn was a Jedi, it would have added to the moral that anyone can be a jedi, not just a Skywalker or a Palpatine, and I think Finn would have had a more compelling story in doing so.
