It’s not that we need to be told it explicitly, it’s that this is both a technique that no other Jedi has ever had even one time, and she is clearly not a Jedi now. The gap between “Leia gets force feelings” and “Leia has a mastery of unknown force techniques to prevent her from dying to space” could very well be 30 years long, but why is that the only fucking time she ever uses the force for ANYTHING that she couldn’t have in the OT? Is that the ONLY piece of evidence (other than the lightsaber she built and never used) that she ever actually learned how to be a Jedi?
