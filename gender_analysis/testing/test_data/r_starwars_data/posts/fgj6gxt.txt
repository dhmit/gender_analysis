Luke’s whole plan to rescue Han in general just seems odd.

-Send Lando in disguise but have him do nothing

-Send in the droids to get captured

-Send in Leia, by herself, to unfreeze Han and then get the two of them captured

-Go in alone, but I don’t have ny lightsaber because I gave it to the droids, to negotiate with Jabba.

-Try to kill Jabba when negotiations fail but since I don’t have my lightsaber I try to grab a blaster from the nearest guard.

-Fight his pet rancor and then get captured because I don’t have a weapon.

-Wait until all of us are literally just about to be executed and then have R2 shoot out my lightsaber and go to town on Jabba’s gang.
