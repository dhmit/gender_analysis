Yeah, I liked the battle of Fin versus Kylo Ren ten times better than Rey against Kylo. It just shows how determined he is to defeat the Sith Lord and be with the force. I was fine with him getting defeated, but they don’t utilize this ever again in the sequel trilogy. Like they could’ve expanded his connection to the force in the next movie, or he could even train alongside Rey. He had so much potential but they dropped it and let Rey become the Jedi of the trilogy.
