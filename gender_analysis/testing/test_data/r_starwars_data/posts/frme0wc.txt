that's primarily why I think tros is the worst film in the series despite it being "technically" better and more proficient than the prequels. it spends so much time nakedly trying to make sure that these sorts of criticisms can't be made by making sure *everything* in the plot is spelled out and set up to an inane degree. it feels like a film made by committee solely in response to tlj's polarising reception, as opposed to anything resembling a work of art driven by a creative vision.
