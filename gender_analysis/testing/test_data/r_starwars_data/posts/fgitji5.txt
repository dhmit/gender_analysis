I mean, I totally agree with you. The Last Jedi is probably my favorite Star Wars movie. I simply ignore most people who use that line to hate on the movie; if they want to willfully ignore what the true message and theme of the movie was (like you said: allow yourself to fail...and then learn from it; failure can happen to anyone at anytime, but that doesn't mean you can't rise from it), that's on them.
