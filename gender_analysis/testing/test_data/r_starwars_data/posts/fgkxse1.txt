This was shot before the accident. Mark Hamillâ€™s accident forced a re-write.   They had the beast. So they just moved the interaction with the cast to taking down Luke.  Changing the opening to what it is now. 

Orsen Wells said the ultimate filming was capturing happy little accidents.  Mark wouldnt say it was happy but accident for sure.
