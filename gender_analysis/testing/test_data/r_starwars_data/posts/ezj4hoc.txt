The thing too is what has EA even done since that colossal screw up back then? I'd say almost nothing cause even though they fixed the game to be somewhat decent now, anything afterwards still shows just how much EA actually cares after their promise 'to be better'. Anthem was a colossal failure, FIFA continues to be EA's biggest cash cow with loot...wait I meant 'Surprise mechanics' galore. 

EA hasn't learned at all, they are just trying to say the right things to calm down the masses before doing it all over again. Only way they will really change their tune is if they see massive drops in stock prices but even then, who's to say once the stock goes back up they will be back do doing what they do best: Fleecing their customers for as much as they can muster.
