The original trilogy shows characters playing that game on the Falcon between missions, and they play it again in the new trilogy. I disagree with you here. Plenty of war movies show how characters spend their down time between missions, and some of them read. Through much of the new trilogy I felt like it was too much of an action film, with no down time or quiet moments to get to know the characters. I know basically nothing about Poe or Finn other than how they fight. Great. It's boring. If they'd been shown engaging with hobbies like reading or spent more time just talking to each other, I would have liked seeing those facets of their characters. We get more of this in the original trilogy, where they're doing other things than fighting, like in Empire, Luke spends much of the movie training on Degobah, and Han and Leia etc are inside the worm. During those moments of non-action you get to know all the characters. The new trilogy has some similar moments for Rey, but really nothing like it for any of the other characters.

So, I think there could be interesting moments of showing characters just trying to survive and keep themselves sane between battles, and I think the films would be better for them because we could have better developed characters then. The original trilogy proved this, it's so much quieter and slower, which gives us time with the characters, and they're better films because of it.
