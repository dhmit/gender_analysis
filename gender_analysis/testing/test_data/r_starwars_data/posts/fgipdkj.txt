Hmm. It's fair that there are seemingly no examples of leisurely/creative writing/reading within the core star wars films and probably much of the extended universe.

But this theory does seem to gloss over the fact that there is a universal language, basic, that also has a universal alphabet, aurabesh.
And aurabesh is seen all over the films in various forms. Largely it is used as signage on military equipment, or through viewfinder on binoculars.

But when we see Coruscant we also see a lot of aurabesh based advertising. And while holograms are used in advertising it's not exclusively used, nor are pictograms. For anyone to bother advertising with the written word we would have to assume a worthwhile market of literate customers exists who can read those advertisements.

There is however significantly less advertising or visible aurabesh, excluding military use, on the poorer planets like Tatooine. We could assume then that literacy rates on these planets are significantly lower than on the more metropolitan planets. And on the other, richer, planets that seem to have minimal writing (like Naboo and Cloud City) it is perhaps just not culturally appropriate to slap text and adverts onto their obviously decorative buildings.
