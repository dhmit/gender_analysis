It's really not that hard to write the sequels better. Hell I did my own tweaks that kept the movies somewhat the same while meshing in EU elements. 

Edit: some of these changes was making the new republic not painfully stupid by having them not demilitarize rather be tied up in a war with criminal powers trying to make a power move which took priority over dealing with more of the empire's remnants nipping at their heels again, Kyle katarn being around still as well as playing a fairly important role in last jedi, and rey having been a student of Luke's Jedi academy that became so traumatized by Ren's massacre that she severed herself from the force and in essence ever forgot she was ever a Jedi in training. Also possesses force psychometry which helps her pick things a bit faster.
