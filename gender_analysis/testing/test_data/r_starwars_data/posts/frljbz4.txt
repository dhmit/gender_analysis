None of the actors want fuck all to do with any more Star Wars.  As for TV show stuff, they did themselves dirty by not putting any time between 7 and 8.  The filler material would be between 8 and 9.

George was smart, he put time between his movies so that he could re-establish and mature the characters along the way.  If he missed something, the expanded universe could fill it in.  We saw so little of the Clone Wars, that naturally it was a great chance to tell great stories.

As it stands, Disney likely wants to forget about the sequels and let the qualified people make up new stories.  Filoni, Favereau, Feige, and Waititi are going to carve out a whole new experience, just like Disney should had taken the time to do with the sequels.
