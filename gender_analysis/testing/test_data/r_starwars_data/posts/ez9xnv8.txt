Eh, even as a person who thought the outrage was over board, the system was pretty fucked. In order to get purple tier cards, you needed somewhere around 480 crafting parts to upgrade (they weren't available in crates iirc), of which you got 30-50 in a crate. Not the worst system I've seen, but I'm glad its gone.
