I always thought it was more about the levity of the scene. They're on the run from the Empire. They're in danger. This isn't a moment for slapstick comedy.

It also seriously mis-portrays C3PO as a character. Taking the sticker off the door implies he understands what will happen and is rather malicious - too much for a bumbling protocol droid!
