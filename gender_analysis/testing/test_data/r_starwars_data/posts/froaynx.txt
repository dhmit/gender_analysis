Ok, let me put it this way. If you remove Canto Bight in its entirety, is the film changed? Not really. If you remove Vader's duel with Luke from Empire, is the film changed? Of course, because there would be no explanation for why Luke is missing a hand, no explanation for how the rescue ended, no explanation for the main event that the entire film was leading up to from the very start in Dagobah. 

Comparing Canto Bight to Vader's confession is kind of disingenuous because Canto Bight has exactly zero weight and consequence in the overall film. Vader's confession is the climax of Empire and as such it can get away with a revelation not left immediately explored to make the audience think about the implications as long as it keeps the story moving and contributes in a satisfying way to character arcs and development.
