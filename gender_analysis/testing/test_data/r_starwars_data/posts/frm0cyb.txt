Finn was the most irrelevant main character I’ve ever seen. I get the sequels were Rey’s story, and the focus should’ve been on her, but the originals were Luke’s story, and yet characters like Han and Leia were still pivotal to the story and actually felt present. Finn felt like a Doctor Who sidekick by the end. 

Such a shame because he had so much potential and was such an interesting character, and John really did play him brilliantly. It was just bizarre how the film presented Finn as this big deal by giving him a cool backstory, putting him all over promotional material etc. and then just swept him under the rug while letting Po fulfil the character archetype that I feel would’ve been more appropriately filled by Finn. Po just kinda came out of nowhere and stayed, being at the heart of the story, while Finn came out of somewhere and didn’t stick at all, and was far distant from the action.
