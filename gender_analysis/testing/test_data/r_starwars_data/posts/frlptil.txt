I just needed to watch the first sequel to know they were gonna do this shit. If they didn't make him a Jedi in that one, they were never going to do it. 

I don't even want to attempt watching the third one. Fuck the dummies who support this shit because they cracked a smile when they were being pandered to. 

They ruined the story worse than Game of Thrones.
