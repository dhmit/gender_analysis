Padme is a such a poor character. As you say, she's all over the place. When she needs to be a badass, she's a badass but when the plot needs her to be a pathetic woman who dies when her husband leaves her, she's that, too. One minute she's a compassionate, strong and intelligent politician and then the next she's falling in love with a murderer, excusing his crimes and acting oblivious to his obvious struggles with darkness. And like most characters in the Prequels, she doesn't even really have a character arc.
