It didn't work. I still haven't forgotten how much I hate those guys. I had the game pre-ordered and couldn't wait for it, but once all the details came out I cancelled and as much as I love Star Wars, I'll never buy another EA Star Wars game. I've got more enjoyable things to do with my time and money -- I just want a casual single-player game with maybe an option for online goofing around. Fuck unlocks. Fuck lootboxes. Fuck EA.
