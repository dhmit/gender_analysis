It borrows from aesthetic and not much else. The Christmas Special is about as close as it gets to the OT, yet is bad. Many books close to the OT are bad, as are many games. Rebels is closer to the OT than TCW, yet TCW is better by a significant margin.

It's an argument that holds absolutely no water.
