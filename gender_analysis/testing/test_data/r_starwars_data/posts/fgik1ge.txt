Not sure of a canon source any longer, but I know it was partially covered in the clone wars episode that had younglings building lightsabers on a training ship, but building a lightsaber is a ritualized used of the force that creates physics defying bonds between the components, allowing the creation of the entire thing. Basically, the components themselves shouldn't be able to create and maintain the energy loop needed to hold a stable blade without melting down. The crystal is a key component, but legends novels have a wide range of crystals being used, not just ilum.
