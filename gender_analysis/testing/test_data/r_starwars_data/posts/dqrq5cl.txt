Took out all of my 90s Kenner figures and ships for my 4 year old daughter to play with. She’s a big fan of the AT-AT and Falcon. The Rancor was a bit too scary for her.

That said, don’t feel behind. I got an early start, yet I still haven’t got her to watch anything outside of episode 2 yet (she fucking loves it). On a side note, I’ve grown to appreciate the goofiness of episode 2 after being forced to watch it over and over again. Despite my best efforts to force the prequels out of my mind, they’re thrust back on me by my own daughter. How cruel life is.
