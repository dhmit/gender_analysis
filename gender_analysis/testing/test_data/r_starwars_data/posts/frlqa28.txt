That was the message of TLJ, at least till they decided to drop it and do Palpatine 2.0 in RoS. The story Rian was trying to setup was that the force isn't some special ability only a select few have and can use. It's essentially a law of the universe like gravity, the difference being that not everyone is as susceptible to it. It's why Rey coming from nobodies, that kid using the force at the end, Yoda burning the ancient text and the death of the Jedi/Sith symbolically (since Rey and Kylo both rejected their respective sides) were major events.  

It was such an interesting story that could have been told about how the force is a fairly neutral entity thats use is dependent on the person and the fact that we have 2 conflicting dogmatic religions based on it has probably caused more harm than good. As for using advanced techniques quickly. I really only think that happens in RoS as there's supposed  before that the most advanced thing Rey or Kylo did was some Force control and mind tricks.
