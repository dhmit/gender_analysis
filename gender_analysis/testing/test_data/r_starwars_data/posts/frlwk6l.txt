I think that's pretty dumb honestly. The film doesn't need a line explaining everything, things like that can be left to the imagination. It's a rather new and frankly juvenile view of art that it owes you everything tied up like that.

We aren't to assume that in thirty years, Leia did exactly nothing that wasn't explicitly mentioned.
