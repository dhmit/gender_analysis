I’m actually more upset that Rey technically became a Jedi in the end. While Disney would never do it, if Rey died and wasn’t brought back then I think thematically that’s better. Rey was “all the Jedi” and palpatine was “all the sith”, and if both of them had died it would have meant the end of both with the only one remaining being Ben solo, one who has become on neither side and allegiant to none. Meaning that the chosen ones throughout time have now balanced the force with no sith and Jedi left to change the tides
