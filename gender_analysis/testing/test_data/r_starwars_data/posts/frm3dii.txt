It was honestly a pretty tone deaf bait and switch. I take no issue with the female empowerment of the new era. Aside from lead characters like Rey and Jyn, you can see that they’ve made a concerted effort to inspire little girls with Forces of Destiny.

Given the fact that there are clearly people at Disney/Lucasfilm who value representation (even if some may be looking to exploit it), someone had to have known what these early images of Finn wielding the lightsaber meant to many Black Star Wars fans. Neither Lando or Mace Windu were a part of the core trios of their respective trilogies, then here comes Finn as potentially THE hero to whom the torch is being passed. 

I’m not saying I need the characters to look like me to love them (Luke and Ahsoka are probably my favorites) but it’d be nice to have a character like that who I could see myself in. We’ve had 12 Star Wars movies, 3 CG animated series, and at least 3 video game franchises starring original characters. No Black protagonists in any of them. Again, it’s not the be all and end all or my highest priority, but given that lack, don’t dangle it in front of our faces like they did with Finn.
