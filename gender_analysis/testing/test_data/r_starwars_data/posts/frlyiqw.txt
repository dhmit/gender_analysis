Mystery box method doesn’t work when all you do is set up questions with no plan for a satisfying payoff at the end.  The entire movie was a rush to the end without enough time to pause and reflect on the sheer volume of material being thrown at you.  Which is why these movies are always worse the 2nd time around or after you’ve had time to think about them.
