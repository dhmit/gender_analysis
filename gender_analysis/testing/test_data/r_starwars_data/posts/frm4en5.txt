Quite the opposite in my opinion.

In TFA, they already start using Finn as comic relief and cheerleader the minute he's flying with Poe.

He gets a great introduction as the traumatized soldier dealing with Phasma etc as part of Kylo's highly trained personal guard and then he's bumbling and whooping his way across Jakku.

Look at how they have him be a janitor at the end of the movie. So suddenly his assignment to Phasma's crew makes no sense.

TFA set up Finn for failure.

And that's not getting into all the structural ways it set up the whole series for failure with retreading the OT setup and cancelling all the heroic accomplishments of the main trio or how it somehow is not able to have the New trio even meet before half the movie is over or the way it simply plops down Death Star 3.0 with no setup.
