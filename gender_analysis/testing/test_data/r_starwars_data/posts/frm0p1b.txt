Yeah, before the prequels I pictured Jedi as something like a secret society, with small numbers spread out all over the galaxy. Something so rare and mysterious that most have never heard of them, and those who have assume it's just tall tales and superstitions. That would have explained how the Empire was able to stamp them out so effectively.

But then the prequels came out and gave them government jobs and a clubhouse in the middle of the most highly populated planet in the galaxy.
