Biggest lie of the decade. Finn’s transformation from stormtrooper to Jedi was laid out perfectly in the trailer. He went from trooper without a way, to Resistance fighter and then to Jedi. The trailer even ended with him fighting Kylo Ren! Abrams should have been berated for his betrayal of John Boyega, as well as Gwendoline Christie’s Phasma. 

Phasma should have been the sole leader after Kylo and Snoke. Imagine instead of the random trooper, it was Phasma dueling a Finn on Max’s planet?! Finn leads the final battle against Starkiller Base and develops a rivalry with her for the trilogy. 

I never felt so betrayed by a franchise like this before.
