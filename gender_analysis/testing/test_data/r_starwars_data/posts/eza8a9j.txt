I don't think anybody was against a progression system in this game or any game. Progression systems if based on achievements and skill can actually give players "a sense of pride and accomplishment". The issue is when randomness and real world money are introduced to the equation. Randomness causes an issue because you can put a ton of time or effort into a game only to open a loot box filled with crap. Money is an issue because it causes a conflict of interest for the developer. If they are charging money for something, especially if it is something that can "be earned for free", it must have some percieved value. This incentivizes Dice to make the grind to unlock things much more tedious. Making the option to skip the grind with real money much more appealing to a player. This is something that is widespread in mobile and is becoming increasingly common in AAA game titles. Having money and randomness tied to the progression system can also make it a nightmare to balance the game. The drops from the loot boxes in BF2 offered actual in game advantages i.e. pay to win mechanics. Trying to buff or nerf anything that needed to be fixed would be very difficult. If a player was spending real money on loot boxes to get an advantage and then Dice took that away through nerfs I feel the player would be pretty irritated. The argument for or against cosmetic microtransactions is one that can be argued for or against. But there is honestly no good points or excuses that can be made to defend putting pay to win lootboxes and progression system in a AAA game title.
