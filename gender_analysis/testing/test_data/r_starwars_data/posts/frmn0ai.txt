Don't get me wrong, I'm not parading TFA around as some terrific movie. But it was fun and set up the trilogy. The biggest flaw of the sequels was the lack of cohesion between the movies. Even rehashed storytelling can be exciting if done well. Shit, 90% of the movies you watch are the same 10 stories but in different settings with different characters.

And Phantom was trash. It's still trash. 20 years later I can see the story it intended to tell, but it's still trash. The prequel trilogy is a series of great ideas told by people who don't know how to make moves
