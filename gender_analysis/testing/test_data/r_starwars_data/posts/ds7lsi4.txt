Yeah I don't think there are any reasonable in universe explanations for that one.  I get it's fantasy but you can't just say that and hand wave away inconsistencies.  I mean people shit themselves that Leia pulled herself back in which IS completely consistent within the universe (and people can survive in space for some time in real life too, btw).  So I don't think it's unreasonable to comment on how something doesn't make sense.  I mean I didn't even say it made the movie bad but like a "true" fan these days you're here to tell me that my opinion isn't valid because it isn't yours.

In fact the more I think about it the more it annoys me.  Buzz off.
