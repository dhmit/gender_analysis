Rey is the Force sensitive protagonist with mysterious parentage that starts the movie on a desert planet. It's Luke from ANH.

The First Order is a mysterious and incredibly powerful threat to democracy like the Empire.

Snoke is the shadowy puppet master behind the dark enforcer Ren/Vader and the ruthless officer Hux/Tarkin.

The last two are actually the only real answers you gave, since I specifically asked for points not lifted from ANH.

Regarding the Knights of Ren, JJ set them up and JJ fucked them up completely. Johnson had nothing to do with that.

In fact, I would probably say the same thing for Finn. His little plot may not have been executed all that well, but it left him in an interesting place at the start of 9. He was just betrayed and saved by love, so what sort of effect would that have on him in 9? If he is sensitive then is he on the path to the dark side? Interesting questions that Abrams was too much of a hack to consider.
