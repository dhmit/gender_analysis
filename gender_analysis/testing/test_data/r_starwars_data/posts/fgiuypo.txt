[Look here!](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Paper/Legends) This is the *Legends* page on “Paper” in Star Wars. As you can see, there are multiple appearances of “paper” throughout the old expanded canon. The sequels have their faults, but paper isn’t one of them.

That is why they are getting downvoted.
