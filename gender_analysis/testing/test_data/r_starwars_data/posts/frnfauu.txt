Short story is that in a race to find R2, a droid with Kylo scans R2’s memory and sees battle plans and intel from the clone war and learns of an unaccounted for Separatist fleet. Kylo finds it, reactivates it, and, at the end of Episode VII is elevated from a force user fighting for relevance in the Order to the leader of a large fighting force.

Edit: in my head version, which only keeps very rough strokes of the sequels:

- Leia is a neutral force user who has hidden her powers. While she has good ends, she is driven by vengeance.

- Han is essentially trying to keep her rage in check and keeping her out of trouble

- Luke has been driven mad by the force ghosts fighting amongst themselves - particularly Anakin and Kenobi

- Rey works for a smuggler group run by a Hutt who is obsessed with droids

- speaking of which, droids are increasingly rare as their manufacture has ceased in the decades of war

- the New Order is a very fractured alliance of former imperial guards  each leading a fragment of what is left of the Empire

- Kylo finds his droid companion when his search for R2 leads him to Rey’s Hutt boss. He takes a deactivated relic of a droid as his own when he destroys the Hutt’s stronghold. Think HK-47 with less comic relief specifically designed for assisting a Sith Lord.

- Kylo is at first a bit player associated with a minor Guard in the New Order who throughout the series commands more and more respect from the New Order troops until he becomes the big baddie at the end of the sequels
