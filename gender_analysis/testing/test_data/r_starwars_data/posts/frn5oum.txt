Rose going with him on this would have been great for her too. She was a smaller part of a bigger machine, so similar to Finn, but she contributed to good, had a family, everything he didn't. But as they're both still young, naive grunts, there could have been actual value in teaming the two of them together to go and convert troopers instead of... letting some weird horses out and then doing nothing for another movie.
