Honestly after watching the first film of the trilogy I was under the impression that Finn is a jedi or at least has the force. Moreover, I wasn't even aware that according to star wars lore ordinary people do not weild light sabres at all because the probability of cutting of your own limb is to high.
As it turned out later, he was just some dude.
