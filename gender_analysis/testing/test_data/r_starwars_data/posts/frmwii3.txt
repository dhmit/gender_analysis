I always thought the story of an orphan, robbed at birth and trained for a lifetime to kill all those who oppose a dictatorial regime having a moment of clarity, defecting and training to become a Jedi felt so much more compelling.

There’s a lot of character to work with there. Lots of internal struggles with shifting beliefs over time. Lots of guilt for doing horrible things despite now championing peace. The blood doesn’t wash off, that might cause him to fall to the Dark Side briefly and give him a chance to see that he is worthy of redemption and forgiveness. 

That’s an actual person with the emotional difficulties of a real person. They had that right in the palm of their hands and they chose.....well, we know what they chose.
