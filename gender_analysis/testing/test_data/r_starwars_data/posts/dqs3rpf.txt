The Lawful <--> Chaotic spectrum, how I understand it, is based upon personal values and principles. It's true that the Empire is very Lawful, and the Sith are probably the best example of Lawful characters. However, the rebels have a rather Lawful intent, which is to bring peace and order to the galaxy. Special emphasis on "order." The rebels want to destroy the established order (which is a bit Chaotic), but they also want to replace it with order of their own (which is Lawful). It would be wrong to classify them as Chaotic imo.
