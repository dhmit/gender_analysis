I thought it would be cool if they trained Finn, then revealed Rey’s lineage early in the film and have Rey try and come to terms with it through the film. So both Kylo and Rey were conflicted. They hinted at the darkness in Rey in 8.

Then used the Rey force lightening Chewie moment, to actually kill Chewbacca. Rey, knowing she’s a Palp, thinks she can’t control it and it’s inevitable that she will join the dark. Palps does a bit of controlling, like Snoke-Kylo and Rey ends up turning and joining forces with Papa Palps. 

Kylo turns to try and save Rey, And he finishes Finns training. Kylo and Finn team up against Rey and Palps. 

Meanwhile, Poe hops in an X-Wing and blows stuff up.
