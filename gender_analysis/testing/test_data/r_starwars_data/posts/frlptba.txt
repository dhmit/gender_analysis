I figured he'd become what ever came next.  I mean the Jedi  and Sith are supposed to be completely dead at the end.  Rey survives, but she's a mix of the dark and light sides of the force.  Not A Jedi, not a Sith.  Something new.  And later She trains Finn in this new whatever it is.  So he's never a Jedi, but he does become something better.
