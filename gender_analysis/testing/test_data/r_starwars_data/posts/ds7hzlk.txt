I've been starting/stopping/starting The Clone Wars for a few months now (almost done with season 1) and I'm determined to get through it because I've heard how great the later seasons are.  But it's just been a bit of a slog through this first season, so thanks for letting me know about this!  I'm sure the podcast will help tremendously in getting through the slow parts and increasing appreciation for the series as a whole.  Looking forward to it!
