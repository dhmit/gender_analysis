I really wanted to like the sequels. But I was so disappointed by nearly every aspect. Disney just seemed to want to play it safe and try to cash in on nostalgia in a way that didn't do the new or old characters justice. 

Finn was the one who got screwed over the most by the indecisive writing that clearly had no plan from the beginning and was so reactionary to outside pressure. The sequels are going to be a textbook example of how *not* to make a trilogy.
