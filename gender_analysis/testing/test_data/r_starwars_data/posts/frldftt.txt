Someone should start a petition to tell Disney that we want him to be head of Star Wars, and that's we'll buy more of their merch if they do, afterall, people like buying merch of things they like, and people ain't likin' Abram or Johnson's Star Wars, but we do like Finiloni's. He basically a gold mine but Ã±oooo, apparently we need more female Star Wars character than an actual good story, according to the current heads of LucasFilms.
