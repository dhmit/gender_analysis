Shields as a rule mainly protect against laser fire, with the exception of larger scale planetary defences and perhaps larger ships. However, you were speaking about hyperspace, which isn't laser fire. While it has been proven that ships can make contact with other ships at sublight speeds without the need for considering shields, it hasn't been proven at lightspeed, although it's probably not unreasonable to say they would have similar results.

Super Star Destroyers and other larger objects may have had more capable shields. In ROTJ, we see the Executor go down to an out of control A-Wing hitting the bridge, but they show the shields generators being destroyed first. Perhaps the Supremacy would have had a similar kind of thing?

Another point I'll bring up is size. We don't know how large something needs to be to cause lightspeed damage worth the cost of a hyperdrive and other materials. Would it ever be worth the cost?
