hamill did say he fundamentally disagreed with how Luke was written in The Last Jedi.  all this can mean, imo, is that luke is not the luke we knew.  could definitely mean dark side, or some kind of "gray jedi" thing, or something.  But definitely not like what we knew.  I think if aged-Luke was just played off like a Ben Kenobi or Yoda, Hamill wouldn't have disagreed with that.  So that tells me it's something else.
