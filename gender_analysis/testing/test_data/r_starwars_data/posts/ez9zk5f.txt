Yet you can't explain what he was wrong about. 

Fact: This game has a tiny group of devs actually working on it, as a result of the "outrage" places like reddit ginned up, and the low sales that followed

Fact: This game actively gets more bugs and more broken with each new update

Fact: A lot of the gameplay changes they've made are objectively worse than what existed at launch (most recently, see jump changes to bossk and grievous)

I know reddit is all about jerking themselves over how great they are for "fixing" this game, but the reality is that they actively *ruined* the game. If there was never any outrage, never any loss of sales, there might actually be a full dev team still working on releasing new content for the game, and a team of testers actually able to test the changes the devs make.
