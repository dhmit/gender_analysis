Worst character development ever. The first film was so promising. And then it all went to shit. Fin finding a ‘family’ of storm troopers was the most cliche cringe worthy thing going.  The fact they decided oh yeh let’s ride our dodgy space horses onto the top of a galactic space ship was just annoying. Don’t care if it was more ‘covert’. It wasn’t.

2 modern trilogies that totally let down their predecessors. 
Star Wars and The hobbit. 

Maybe matrix 4 will save us.
