I call BS. They should've pulled an LOTR, got one director, planned out the entire trilogy from the start than shot it all back to back. Apart from the Hammill, Ford, Fisher and Issac, they were all unknown actors/actresses who would've not blinked at signing away three years of their life.

We would've had another Return of the King award season and something new to top "Best Movie Series" lists.

What I'm really trying to say is Rian Johnson should've kept his dirty hands off the precious.
