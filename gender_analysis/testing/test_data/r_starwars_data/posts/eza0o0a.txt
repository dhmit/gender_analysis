How it works for both comments and posts is upvotes are added to your account in a log ratio: for the first few upvotes it's 1:1, but the more upvotes you get on a given comment/post, the less karma you get per upvote. I feel like comments have a more generous ratio than posts, but that's just my feeling, posts get more upvotes anyways.  Downvotes are hard capped at -10 karma I believe.
