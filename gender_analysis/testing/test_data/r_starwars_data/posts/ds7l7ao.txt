No, just ones that don't follow their own logic. All of the star treks have plenty of things that don't make sense, but you accept them because you just accept that it works that way in that universe. But clearly it doesn't work that way in the star wars universe, and all of the sudden it does. I am clearly not the only one thinking this, and almost half of people agree. It was not a terrible movie, but it was not star wars.
