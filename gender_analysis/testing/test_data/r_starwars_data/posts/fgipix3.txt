Okay hear me out- when I saw this scene years ago somebody commented saying that George Lucas intentionally kept the idea of paper out of the Star Wars universe to make it seem more alien and unique. That was a small detail that I cherished and thought it was a great example of the amazing world building that Star Wars has.
