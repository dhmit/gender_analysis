That's a question I had. It seemed like everyone no matter who they were was force sensitive. Kinda defeats the purpose of Jedi/sith being the force sensitive characters in the story if anyone can do it. 


Another thing I had an issue with is that seemingly novice force users could master the most advanced techniques in a matter of moments...
