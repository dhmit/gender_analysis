By the time of the Tarkin novel, which is 5 years after Revenge of the Sith, Vader still had one clone sergeant in the 501st, but he was definitely getting old and Vader threatened him with retirement every time he was displeased.    


There was also a clone trooper in the Emperor's royal guard, but I don't know how long that lasted.
