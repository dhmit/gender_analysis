When I was young my mom told me that Mark Hamill had been in a car accident that left him with lacerations to the face. This was apparently why they wrote in the whole thing of Luke getting attacked by a wampa. 
I always figured that's why they cut the wampas attacking the rebel base sequence.

EDIT: Found this article referencing it.
