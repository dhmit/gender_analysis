What if Rey was this badass female Jedi master from the beginning that found Finn and taught him to be a Jedi after Luke died. Sorta like the Anakin x Obi Wan & Qui-gon dynamic. They spend the first film trying to find Luke so he can train Finn but in the second movie he dies. It would've actually subverted expectations.
