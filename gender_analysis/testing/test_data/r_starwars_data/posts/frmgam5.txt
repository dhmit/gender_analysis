Ha. Ha. You have has your expectation S U B V E R T E D. 

Seriously though. Reys actrice and character did pretty well but the "surprise its a woman" type of feminism didnt do anything good for the series. Especially when they could have just been straight up with the marketing. It wasnt just like he was robbed, it was like he was given money just to get it robbed. The entire series just devolved into a game of "Gotcha!"
