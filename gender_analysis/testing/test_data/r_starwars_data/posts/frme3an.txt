I mean, that seems to be the one clear message they were sending with the trilogy.

Think about the ending of Last Jedi, with the random kid sweeping a floor pulling the broom to him. 

Think about all the people who are implied to be force sensitive. Finn was supposed to be trying to tell Rey she was force sensitive the whole last movie, but JJ forgot to put that back in after shooting it.

I totally thought that entire platoon that defected was implied to be force sensitive. 

Poe has to be at least force sensitive to be as good a pilot as he is. He could fly circles around Luke, who was the best pilot in the resistance, because he could use the force.

There's probably others, but I saw each of those movies once and probably won't go back to look for things.
