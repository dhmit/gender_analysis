I mean, I'm genuinely not sure how else to interpret that statement. Even if Anakin didn't physically harm her in the long run, she heard about her husband becoming definitively evil and brutally slaughtering a massive chunk of his religious order, broke down in front of him, got *choked out for it* and then had to deal with *twins* - something that does regularly fuck people up - while under the medical care of a droid that's probably awfully shit at diagnosing human mental conditions. Her mental state is objectively completely fucked by that point; 'her mind literally couldn't continue supporting her body' is a pretty reasonable way to go out.
