That fucking ominous slow walk it made towards you..

I used to just run away from them until I got brave enough to fight em. Damn near shit meself when they turned up in the canyon level too. Trying to run past them and continue on with the level, only for it to still be slowly making its way toward you like It Follows or some shit...
