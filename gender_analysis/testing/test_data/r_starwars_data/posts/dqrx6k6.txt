You mean the one where a girl got pregnant from his son who she's been dating for three months? I'd want her to get an abortion aswell, having children should be a mutual decision when you both agree you can support it growing up. She saying "nah fam, I'm good, I'm keeping it, but your money is welcome is though" is really selfish.
