You do when he’s black and China says no. 

That’s not my opinion. That’s what they did. Everything hinted at it being him, not just the images. The opening scene of VII, remember? Kylo senses him. Why? Why the stare down?

Disney is not some “woke” company or whatever the shit. They are profiting off of progressive ideas but they aren’t actually progressive themselves. Companies are not progressive, and they do not care about people at all. Something needs done about that.

Oh, billions of Chinese don’t like black people? That’s fine, let’s pivot to feminism. $$$
