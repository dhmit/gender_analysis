I can't wait for ten (maybe 15) years from now when people are finally sick of shitting on the sequel films. We get it. You didn't like them. I didn't like the prequels when they came out -- but I didn't spend my life telling everyone about it.

It just gets in the way of a sub like this being about fun and enjoyment.
