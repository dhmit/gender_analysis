Honestly...I disagree. I liked him as a badass normal with a freaking laser sword, pissed off at the emo whiny Kylo Ren who hurt his friend. Force-sensitive? Sure, sign me up.  
But Jedi? Naw. Finn was proof you could wield a saber and not be a Jedi, and even hold your own in defense of a friend- it was brave, utterly insane, and my favorite Finn moment in the ST.   
Plus, I suspect they wanted to save the Reyveal of her saber fight for the film, so they shoved Finn with a saber everywhere.   


But yeah, he definitely got shafted in character development more and more, before being entirely sidelined and borderline useless. He could've been neat. But no, he had to be the sidekick to a YA protagonist written by a 40-something filmmaker who loves the idea of StarWars more than StarWars itself.
