Naaah.... they'll rather go for a Disney happy end. 

After blowing up the Falcon for some reason, Chewie goes back to Kashyyk with Maz and they live happy ever after. 

Force ghost of Han appearing, with Luke's and Artoo's. (yep, he died too... and he's got a Force ghost because JJ said so).

End credits.
