yeah Mark Hamill did a ton of voice over work.  Since he was kind of type cast as Luke, I think it was hard for him to get other work. So he did voice over work for cartoons, video games, etc... Same thing kind of happened with Adam West, except he didn't know about voice over work for quite some time and he only got into it when he was quite old.  Adam West, also a fine man. RIP Adam.
