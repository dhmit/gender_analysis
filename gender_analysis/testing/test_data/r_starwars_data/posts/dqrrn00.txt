> now i'm older and have a more mature mind. being devoid of emotion doesn't make you good. it makes you impassive and neutral, which can be just as bad as being evil if it serves your purpose. 

You are right, the Jedi will always be slaves to the force unable to express their emotions least they fall to the dark side. We should listen to Space Nietzsche (Kreia from KotOR 2) and destroy the force, only then can we escape the constant cycle of violence from the constant civil Jedi Wars caused by the Sith and the Jedi.

The Force is Dead and we have have killed it
