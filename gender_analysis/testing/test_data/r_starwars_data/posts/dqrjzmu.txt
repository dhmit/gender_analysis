But how many Jedi would have been manipulated into darkness via their connections if they had been allowed? "Do X to save this single person, or do Y to save the galaxy as a whole?" The idea of Padme dying to unknown causes was enough to make Anakin vulnerable; what if somebody kidnapped or killed a Jedi's wife? The average Jedi would be at much greater risk of falling.

The problem with Anakin was that he was trained too late in life. Jedi are supposed to be raised with those ideals, to reject those kinds of connects and to see them as the risks they are. Their parental figures, the Jedi themselves, would espouse to them how they shouldn't even become too attached to *them*. Anakin, however, was raised by his doting mother. He had already formed strong connections by time he even entered training, and it was too late to try and teach him that those sorts of connections were bad.

Connections to his mother led to the slaughter of the Sand People. Connections to Padme led to his entire fall. Hell, connection to his son actually led to his "fall" from the Dark Side back into the light. It's not even a Dark versus Light thing... connections just inhibit focus and dedication. It's not like Palpatine had a side piece that made him soft.

No wonder Kylo Ren is so bent on killing his own family. They're a huge weak point for any Force user, *especially* Skywalkers.
