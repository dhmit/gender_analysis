I thought Palpatine was planting the visions to corrupt Anakin. He found a weak point and pried it open. The Jedi, having fought against manipulators like Palpatine for thousands of years, tried to train their students nearly from birth to be immune to this sort of emotional manipulation, but that sort of training only works if you can start it extremely young, while the mind is more malleable and trainable. This would have been an old standby Sith move by this point. Their best recruiting comes by corrupting powerful Jedi. They barely have to train them, and the chaos caused by the fall of a Jedi is nearly a weapon in and of itself. He used Dooku pretty effectively, and Dooku didn't have half of Anakin's potential. 

So that's why the entire Jedi order is focused around the idea of mental discipline, fortitude, and resilience. When your enemy is constantly trying to corrupt your best and brightest, you need to give them the best defense possible against those tactics. You have to teach them to be completely impassive and immune to emotional manipulation.

That's why they were worried about taking Anakin on in the first place--they were worried that it was too late to properly train him to resist the dark side. They were right.

However, they were between a rock and a hard place. They could tell Anakin was going to be an extremely powerful force user, and leaving him out on his own almost guaranteed he would end up being sought out by the sith. So they decided to risk taking him into their own and training him, despite knowing the danger of starting the training so late in life. 

This ended up leading to their downfall anyway. Because, despite having a huge weak spot, Anakin was allowed to join the Jedi Council because of his power and feats of valor in the Clone Wars. You would think that power and feats of valor wouldn't really matter that much in the meditation-centric order of the Jedi, but there you have it. Maybe they were trying to soothe his ego by doing so, but that doesn't seem like the actions of such a strict and reserved religious order either.

I guess that was why they refused to name him Master despite being on the council. It takes skill to take a sword by the handle and swing it at your enemy. It takes mastery to hold a sword by the blade without being cut. Anakin could use the Force effectively, but that didn't make him a Master of it. And Palpatine saw exactly where he needed to apply pressure to take advantage of that fact.

Anyway, Anakin's position on the council made Palpatine's power grab that much more effective. He had a man on the inside. A man who could walk right into the Jedi temple to see the padawans without the alarm being raised. A veteran general who the clone soldiers respect, and who could lead them in their uprising against the Jedi. A friend and confidant of many jedi (including the Masters) who might know or guess their hiding spots and refuges. 

By accepting Anakin as a padawan, the Jedi sowed the seeds of their own destruction. But they also didn't really have any better choices. They had to roll the dice and hope the Force would guide him to the mastery he needed, when he needed it. And it did. Eventually. In the closing scenes of ROTJ.
