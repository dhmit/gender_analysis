I don't think that would have happened.  Uncle Owen knew about Luke's lineage, so he would have either kept Luke around with bullshit reasons indefinitely or, if things came to a head, tell Luke the truth about his father and why he couldn't go to the Academy.

Or he could be murdered in his front yard, that too
