No one calling him Baby Yoda actually thinks it's Yoda. As we don't have a name, nor a name for the species, it just makes sense that Baby Yoda is the first thing everyone has clung to as an easily identifiable name. It sounds better than the official name of "The Child" when used every day all over the internet, as it's being used at the moment.

That being said, I don't think any name that they do eventually come up with is going to please everyone, so it'll probably stick even then too...!
