Even give him the first 45 min of Ep.8 and have him go away looking for others like a separate side quest that can be fleshed out in the books. Then in Ep.9 pull in with like four Star destroyers fully manned on Exogel all with Rebel markings instead of the all the ragtag ships that came....like cool it was a lot, but what's the point of coming to help the resistance in your unarmed freighter. Would've made the reveal so much better and his plot point to help others taken into the first order that much more redeeming.
