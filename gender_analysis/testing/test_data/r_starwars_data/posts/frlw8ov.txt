I originally thought the point of “the big three” (rogue stormtrooper, republic pilot, backwater junker) was that they would all eventually become force sensitive: three people from three drastically different walks of life all bond together to form the new Jedi order. Their force sensitivity would have been the result of some type of cataclysmic event (like if palpatine got resurrected by a bunch of ancient sith wierdos or something crazy like that), erego the title The Force Awakens.

My hopes were too high.
