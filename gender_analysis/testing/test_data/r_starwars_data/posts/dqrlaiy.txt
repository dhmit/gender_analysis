Arguably, a huge part of Anakin's confidence in Palpatine was that he couldn't confide in any of his fellow Jedi (or even his best friend, Obi-Wan) what his actual problems and fears were, because admitting he had a wife and kids on the way would mean expulsion from the Order. 

An Jedi Order that allows attachments and emotions like love, while offering paths of guidance to help sort through the more negative, Dark side leaning fears and whatnot that come packaged with the more positive emotions, is an Order where Anakin probably never falls, because he has people he can work through his fears with, people he can admit his failings to, and a whole part of his life he doesn't have to hide. The secret Sith lord suddenly isn't Anakin's only confidant, and has much less influence over the most powerful Force User in history. An Order where Anakin doesn't have to hide his love and his wife and his emotions is an Order that can back him up in those tough times. 

Remember is the beginnings of Episode 3, how Palps reminds Anakin that he told him about the Sand People Massacre? The only person Anakin felt he could admit that failing to was also the man who wanted to manipulate and twist him into an instrument of evil. Imagine if Anakin could've admitted what he did to his fellow Jedi, and gotten help processing all the emotional baggage from his premonition and later massacre. He can then bring his next set of personal premonitions to his fellow Jedi,  without having to be evasive about who and what he's seeing, and get the help he needs to not fly off the handle and seek Dark side solutions. If he can confide his actual problems and fears to his fellow Jedi instead of the secret Sith lord, Palps has way less of in to manipulate him.
