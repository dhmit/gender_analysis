I dunno man, it would be cool to see but itâ€™s not right for the film. The first act of RotJ is there to surprise the audience at how much more skilled and powerful Luke is since the last we saw him. Saving the lightsaber reveal until the big fight is a really awesome moment and it would be ruined by knowing about its existence prior to that imo.
