Harrelson does have a few incidents of misconduct in his past, like smashing a London cab in 2002 and punching a phographer. Don't think there was anything sexual, but he's not as clean as some.

Tom Hanks though... I'd be gutted. Loves the environment, big supporter of gay rights, loves space, veterans, supports many causes, etc etc.

I guess there's at least one person who might have an issue, as he divorced his first wife.
