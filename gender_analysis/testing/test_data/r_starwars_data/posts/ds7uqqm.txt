He's literally the only alien that has some meaningful interaction with the plot. Relatively speaking of course, because you could have removed literally every other alien besides him from TLJ and it would not have changed anything about the plot.

At least with Disney keeping Chewie around to sell toys there will be at least one relevant alien onscreen to remind me that Star Wars has aliens

And yes they could add other relevant non-humans to the plot, and I wish they would but they clearly aren't going to, I mean they wrote Holdo into the story to steal Ackbar's glory because humans are more relatable to wider audiences. They could have written her as another Mon Cala, a Chiss, or one of the new aliens from Planet Bellagio, anything!
