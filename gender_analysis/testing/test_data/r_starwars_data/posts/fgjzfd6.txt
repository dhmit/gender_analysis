This is the kind of thing I wish was added back and completed in the special editions vs some of the special edition things we got lol. This scene (add another one of wampas being a problem in the base for context) and some of the Luke training with Yoda scenes ( here: [https://youtu.be/rnXI\_LT42KY?t=50](https://youtu.be/rnXI_LT42KY?t=50) ) would have been great.  


What I like about this is that it's a welcome surprise, it's the kind of assholery R2-D2 would do, but coming from C-3PO makes it hilarious and extra awesome.
