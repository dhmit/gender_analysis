I was just sitting here watching The Flash season 2 and there is this crazy guy in a prison cell and I can't figure out where I know the guy from, he just seems so familiar and then I refresh Reddit on the other screen when the scene shifts and this is the top post on r/all and I'm like....oh man....it's Mark Hamil.....thanks Reddit! You are like magic.
