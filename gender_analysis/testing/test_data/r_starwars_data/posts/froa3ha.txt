After EP 8 everyone was happy on where the saga it seems to go. I said back then that the film was crap because it destroyed almost all characters but Kylo and Rey.

Now it seems that people are understanding that Disney have messed up big time with Ep 8 and 9. I'm happy that people are seeing that.
