Not sure. I like to think it'd go down like this:

Luke would unconciously use the force as a pilot, he'd rise through the ranks to become a member of the elite. 

The Emprah would pick up hints of this force user and task Vader with rooting out the force sensitive to kill in case he ever became a threat. 

Vader finds Luke, discovers the truth about who he is (somehow) and secretly trains him until together, they take over the Empire.

And lived happily ever after.
