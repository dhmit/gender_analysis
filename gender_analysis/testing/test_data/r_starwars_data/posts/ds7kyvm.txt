I'm thinking proximity.  They let her get close enough to nearly ramp up to hyperdrive without crossing into fold space (I'm pretty sure they don;t use light speed plus in STar wars.)  ALso unique situation, a similarly sized ship, but only one passenger, and she's a kamikaze.  Not a I beam with a warp drive.
