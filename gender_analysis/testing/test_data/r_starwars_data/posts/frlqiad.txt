Another theory of equal possibility is that Vader himself stole her life force to sustain his life until the emperor arrived. That would be even worse, in my opinion, because it would make Palpatine's words actually true; in his anger, he killed her. It also makes Vader's reaction more understandable. Instead of just mindless rage aimed at the emperor, it's all directed inward. He said that he felt she was alive, but that might have just been him lying to himself, or he could feel she was alive because he was actively siphoning off her life force. Also, it would come full circle that he was actually finally strong enough to save her, as the emperor promised he would be, but in his rage and hatred he killed her instead. Ironic.
