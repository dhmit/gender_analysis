If you can move objects around in space using the Force, why couldn't you move yourself?  You're an object in space. 
Anyway, claiming that it's not "a thing" doesn't make any sense.  Every Force technique we've ever seen wasn't a thing until someone did it. Being able to move objects with the Force was not a thing until Luke did it in Empire.  Do you also have a problem with that?
