Yeah, it's weird to me that Every force sensitive character would need to be trained. In my head canon, which may or may not be supported by old novels, there are plenty of untrained force sensitives. Like Luke on Tattooine, they may be prone to unusual coincidence or good luck, but they aren't necessarily ever using the force on purpose. Most of them never notice there's anything different about them.
