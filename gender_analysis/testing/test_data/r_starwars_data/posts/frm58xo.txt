Nah, first Finn goes Jedi, then convinces Kylo to go Jedi. His former dark master becomes Finn's first Padawan. Rey goes full dark because of her palpatine roots and both new Jedi defeat Snoke and her, leaving the force ghosts to defeat the semi-dark force, semi-living-actual-matter Palpatine. Then create new storylines with Finn and Kylo as the new central Jedi Masters scouring the galaxy to rebuild and shit, while the dark side rebuilds itself in the same new storylines. You've already established there's long-lost Palpatine's and Skywalkers. I'm sure there's others of Yoda's species, Darth Maul, and so on. Then copycats, different branches of the philosophies (grey jedi, green, blue, etc.). Fuck, it's owned by Disney after all. Between theatres and streaming shows they can go in all kinds of directions. 

Now what? Rey is the top dog and Finn is her associate? Like Bronn following Tyrion around in Game of Thrones but way less interesting as a character? Pretty boring. You can bring in female Jedi Masters in ensuing stories. Hell, you can even save the woman killing Kylo story for later when he turns back to the dark side in a couple of decades into the rest of his story. 

It's like, they had the makings of a good premise, but then the woman who came from nowhere with no training somehow wins with little to no training from anyone had to win with no real explanations. I like the idea that her talent comes from the semi-force power that Palpatine is able to project through her. So when she goes bad, gets disarmed, learns her true nature, decides to sacrifice herself so that she won't be controlled by the dark side. Regrettably, she does this before they can kill Palpatine later, but when he's killed, Rey's force ghost makes an appearance alongside Luke, Yoda and the gang.
