Got a row F, six seats for me and some friends (most of them in my current D&D group), earliest showing on Friday morning so it's a half-full theater.

Row F was my compromise (as I was buying the tickets and had the choice).  I like being closer to the screen (not like A or B close, granted), but some of my friends like further back, so I went for the middle.

Obviously reclining seats.  Pretty much every screen at two of the theaters near me has reclining seats now.  Not sure about the other two.

We're all hyped.  And I'm glad I have bosses who understand that Star Wars is a big part of my life and let me declare New Star Wars Movie Day one of my "floating" holidays each year.  (Heck, our department VP even called out my love of Star Wars last year at our Christmas event.)
