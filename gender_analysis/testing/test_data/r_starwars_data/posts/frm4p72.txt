So basically like what clone wars did for the clones in the umbara arc (and the rest of the show but it was really focused on during umbara), arguably one of the best arcs in a TV show ever, but for stormtroopers. That's would have been great.

We could've had Fin run across more dead troopers that he knew and have taken care of them, so like after a battle we see him organizing the dead, but just like a bunch of piles of dirt or something to symbolize them cause it's supposed to be available for kids and just a pile of corpses isn't something you show off in broad daylight, and on the edge of a mental collapse. Or we could have a depressed Fin, sitting alone when everyone else is celebrating a victory, and when one of our main cast, like Rey, which would give her something to develop off of too and would send him away from her as a love interest, asks him why he isn't celebrating he tries to just brush them away gently, giving hints that he doesn't want to talk about it, and referencing a problem a lot of guys have of wanting to deal with their problems alone, before they press further and say something about how they really showed those bucket heads. Then he snaps and starts shouting, yelling at whoever had talked to him about how they wheren't just a bunch of machines that killed, they where people, people why where taken from their family and raised from birth to fight for the first order. Faceless, without a name of their own. It would have driven home the point, that the trilogy tried to make, that your name doesn't matter, where you came from doesn't matter, what matter is what you do here and now.

But no, he has one of the highest stormtroopers kill counts in the movies, apart from Poe, Holdo, and Rey. Who destroyed a planet, a fleet, and another much larger fleet in that order.
