Basically this.  Ford was terrified of being typecast, he distanced himself a lot from the Indiana Jones character as well off-screen.  It's perfectly understandable in the age he started acting - in the 70s and 80s, typecasting was rampant (look at Bruce Willis, who is forever "that guy who can do action movies" after *Die Hard*) and it killed a lot of actor's fervor for the business when they found out that nobody would take them seriously in anything but their "assigned" type of role.
