The whole order was designed to minimize those threats from a young age, and then remove those who might be a problem before they learn enough to become a serious threat. By the time they were Anakin's older age, they shouldn't *need* that counselling, so no resources existed for it.

And the reason they simply expelled or refused people who were prone to issues is because they saw it as too dangerous to give potentially unstable people the ability to tap directly into the universe's greatest power. Better to have one less Jedi, than risk having one more Sith. 10,000 members got a *lot* of shit done across the entire galaxy; they could afford to be wildly choosy.

Making an exception for Anakin because he was powerful was the absolute worst possible move they could have made.
