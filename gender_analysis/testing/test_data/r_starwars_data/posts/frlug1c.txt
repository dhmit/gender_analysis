That would've been fucking awesome. Like, could you imagine watching him rally all these Stormtroopers and causing a big insurrection, and then in the final battle they just warp in all Rogue One-Ravager style and fuck shit up in their liberated Star Destroyers? 

A bunch of actual and literal lifers that can actually do damage and turn the tide, instead of a bunch of morons showing up in the dinky little unarmed haulers? 

It could've even been apart of why no one showed up to help them in Ep. 8! Like there's the main war going on, but all the systems are having to deal with insurrection in the FO and all the shady shit that would be going down with that.
