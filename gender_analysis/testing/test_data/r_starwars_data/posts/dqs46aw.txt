Many actors are known particular for one or two iconic roles. Nobody else could come close to these roles without drawing comparison. For example, Kevin Conroy might have been in other things but he IS Batman. Charlie Cox has been in other projects but he IS Daredevil. Stallone IS Rocky Balboa. So on and so forth.

Hamill’s known for three roles over thirty-some years. He is and will always be Luke Skywalker. Nobody else has been able to match his Trickster. His Joker is the best there will ever be. There’s nobody else who fits in any of these roles better than Mark.
