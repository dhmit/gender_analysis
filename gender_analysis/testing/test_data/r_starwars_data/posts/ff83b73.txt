Samsung only supplied the LED display during the 1st phase of iPhone X production. After a good relationship developed with LG during the introduction of the 1st Gen Apple Watch, Apple decided to expand upon that and phase out Samsung and replace with LG throughout the rest of the production. Another reason Apple chose to switch was the issue with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) that was inherent to Samsung displays at the time. It caused headaches (especially to those prone to light sensitivity) because it displayed at an unpleasant refresh rate. Explains why it took so long for them to switch to LED. They always touted themselves as having the widest color gamut, and because they couldn't release an LED display with the same gamut and "high enough" refresh rate, it's telling that they rushed a subpar display at the time they did. Felt a bit rushed is what I'm saying. Long rant of shit but w/e.
