Finn was wasted.

Poe was wasted.

The Skywalker name was sullied.

The reality is simple: there *was* no coherent payoff at the end of this series.   EP4-6 had a satisfying arch, with good character development.  EP1-3?  We knew what was coming, just not the path that would lead us to it.  EP7-9 didn't feel like it was a good, cohesive vision, and the payoff was definitely flat.
