They did Finn so dirty. Like everything he overcame in TFA, Rain Johnson was like fuck it let’s have him go the same arc of being a coward and running away AGAIN! Let’s also sideline him with the stupidest mission in the movie with an extremely poor written character.

How anyone can defend TLJ is beyond my comprehension. That movie was pure dog shit.
