There is a series of essays and interviews by David Brin in which he lays out a pretty good case for Yoda being the bad guy of the Star Wars series.  He lays it out that Yoda is, in his opinion, the most evil character in modern literature because he is never helpful, he is supremely manipulative, and he is carrying out an agenda that only he knows with the knowledge that it is going to cause Billions or even Trillions of lives to be lost.
