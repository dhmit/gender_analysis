I am not saying your opinion isn’t valid. You’re simply not being imaginative enough to think of possible ideas that could make it work. Maybe that’s the first time someone actually ever tried something so insane like lightspeed ramming? A last ditch effort because there were no other options left. If that’s not the case, maybe, ships too small wouldn’t be effective. Maybe no one does it because it’s a terribly cost/reward means of taking down ships. Those big cruisers can be cheap. It seems those big ships and even Death Stars are pretty easy to take down otherwise with much less waste if you look at past movies. This just some things I could think of as possibilities and would certainly not be the only ones. You could pick them apart but there could be another good explanation I didn’t even mention.

And you know what, maybe you are right but I think tossing the idea aside that is just doesn’t work without hearing anything official seems a bit silly. I’d rather say, we don’t know yet but here’s some possibilities.
