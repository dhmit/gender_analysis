Mark is just following the rules of another set of Sci-Fi icons:

*"Be excellent to each other"*

I know they're not really Bill and Ted's words, when they were written by some Hollywood writer type (like the type who'd probably spell a name backwards to come up with a villains name). 

But still a nice rule in life to abide by.
