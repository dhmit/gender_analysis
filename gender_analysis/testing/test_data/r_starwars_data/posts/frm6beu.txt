Kid 1:  ya... ya... and then the Emperor comes out.  And he’s connected to a giant machine..

Kid 2:  ya ya...  and he raises his arm and all these space ships comes out..

Kid 3:  oh..  oh... and The Jedi girl raises her hands and lighting comes out and blast all the ships in space.   

Kid 2:  oh.  Ya. Ya..  because she’s the emperor’s grandkid.  

Kid 1:  oh that’s good.   Oh.  Oh.  And all these rebel space ship shows up.

Kid 3:  ya. Ya.  No..  make the rebel space ship come first.

Kid 1:  right right... and the the Bad Jedi. Becomes good..

Kid 3:  ya.. ya..  because he loves her..
