The worst part about that too, is that it means ONLY the force sensitive stormtroopers get out. It totally diminishes his leaving the First Order; originally portrayed as due to his recognition of the horrible nature of war, servitude, and child indoctrination, instead its because he’s a special, force sensitive stormtrooper. It’s not a choice and Finn loses all agency.
