They imply Fin is force sensitive but never say it outright. What killed me in Episode 9 is Fin, Rey and Poe are sinking in a sand pit and Fin says to Rey... “ Rey I never told you.... “ then fath into the cavern, but they never go back to this in the movie. Was he going to say, I love you, I know who your parents are, I know about Palatine and the Sith?! Fin being a Jedi was a missed opportunity.
