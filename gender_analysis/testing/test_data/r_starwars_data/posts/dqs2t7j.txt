It's a shame because he knew that Obi Wan loved another, but didn't feel strong enough to go to him with more details. Even though the Jedi Council already knew that Anakin had deep feeling for Padme and was at risk.

Additionally it makes sense for the Jedi to hide that given that the Dark Side is more like a drug than an emotion. It consumes someone and takes over their lives. The Jedi telling their own not to fall in love is like a family with history of drug abuse telling their children not to experiment with heroin.
