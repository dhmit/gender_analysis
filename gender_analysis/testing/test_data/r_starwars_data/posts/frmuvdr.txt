The way I would have done it was have both Rey and Finn trained as Jedi by Luke. First movie, they discover his location and he decides to train them. By movie three, they set out to confront Kylo who I'd have written as a badass Dark Jedi or Sith Lord that needed both Rey and Finn to defeat him. 

Definitely would have had a love interest bloom over the course of the trilogy between Rey and Finn. Perhaps a forbidden love as they are Jedi and it complicates things. 

I think that would have interested me more than the tripe we got.
