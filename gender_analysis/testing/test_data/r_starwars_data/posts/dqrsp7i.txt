Which is part of his issue with Star Wars.  I don't think he would have hated it if it had been a flop.  But it changed the culture and film culture.  I am not saying I think he is mad at it for over shadowing his career but mad at it for changing what became an important movie.  Star Wars became more important than a lot of serious movies and to a guy like him that was a tragedy.
