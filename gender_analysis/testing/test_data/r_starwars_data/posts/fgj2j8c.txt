Other examples I haven’t seen mentioned here or downthread (not in the movies, but still semi-canon):
1. The Wills— Lucas’ original conception of Star Wars was that it was journals or a book written by a historian. The official ANH novelization mentions this (not Canon, but semi-canon at the time and ghost-written by Lucas)
2. News media mentioned in the novelization of Episode III, like those cameras *do* broadcast to galactic TV (not Canon, but still semi-canon)
3. [The Journals of Ben Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Journals_of_Ben_Kenobi) that Luke reads in the Canon SW comics shows Luke can read

Edit: And the [Jedi Archives,](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Archives) have text documents (Canon in Episode II and III)
