"The force." is a useful tool for writers to write themselves out of a plothole. When it's used, it's because the writers don't have time to come up with or implement an explanation. It works fine because most audiences are complicit with "it's magic", and the nerds are fine with it too because it's incredibly likely the same thing or similar thing happened before with the boatload of stuff that exists in the Expanded Universe.
