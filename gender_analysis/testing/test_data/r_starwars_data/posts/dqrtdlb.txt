They stood for balance but still did not want the Sith that represent a whole side of the force. Death and destruction is part of life and the sith are embodiments of that. 

Meanwhile, the Jedi want peace and will enforce that through the force. 

The true way to balance is to embrace both the good and the bad, but be disciplined enough to control both sides. To not suppress or be overcome by your emotions, but instead accept, acknowledge and work through them. Make them part of you instead of cutting them off or becoming part of them. 

That is why the Grey Jedi are the true balance of the Force. And Windu was a pretty grey Jedi. So was Dooku. 

The Jedi were pretty good for stability, but then again, so we're the Sith. Both brought peace to the galaxy. However, balance of the Force is not equal to law and order or peace.
