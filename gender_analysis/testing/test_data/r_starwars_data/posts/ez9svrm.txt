My stance with it right now is that it wasnt great day one but compared to then it's great now. Some people are still in the dark ages and still believe it's got lootboxes and more people still chose to only highlight its downfalls. Yes. I acknowledge it's got downfalls but what's the point in only being negative, I get enough negativity outta life already lol
