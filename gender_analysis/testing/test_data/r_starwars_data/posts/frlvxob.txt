> How is anyone supposed to know that? That information wasn't in the film

What's worse is that Luke explicitly says in TLJ:

> "He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest."

So Kylo killed a bunch of padawans off-screen (maybe a few children) and took some of them with him... and we already knew about the "Knights of Ren" being Kylo's crew from TFA.  So it only makes sense for the Knights of Ren to be the students that Kylo took with him, right?  Fuckin' nope!  The Knights of Ren were retconned into being "the wrong crowd" that Kylo, the good boy at heart, gets mixed up with.  They're a gang that helped push Kylo into being kinda evil but not really, and then followed Kylo after he killed their leader.

EDIT:

Oh, and Luke's students that Kylo took with him are never brought up ever again.  So who knows where they went.
