RIAN JOHNSON didn’t know what to do with his character. Or more accurately, he didn’t care about his character, or any others. The Force Awakens sets up Rey, Finn, and Kylo to potentially have interesting character arcs. Then Rian Johnson threw away all of that potential with his “I’m not going to do what you think I’m going to do” bullshit while going on an insane ego trip. Last Jedi is a car, stuck in mud, spinning it’s wheels, destroying its tires in the process. Rian Johnson had a huge opportunity to build on the ideas of The Force Awakens, but he squandered it in the worst way possible. It was the second act, but he treated it like a pointless sidequest all the while thinking that it was going to blow audiences minds. There was nothing for JJ to salvage in The Rise of Skywalker. They just had to retcon, and recontextualize everything so that The Rise of Skywalker could limp across the finish line. Someone with balls should have thrown Rian Johnson out of the studio onto his stupid melon shaped head when they read his first script. But they just when with it because ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
