Yeah could have had Rey and him training under Leia (with a time skil after TLJ). I mean, he was marketed as the new Luke and then they made him a joke character (space janitor, “big deal”, the “Reeeey!!! Shouting).

Having John as a Jedi beside Daisy would have been grand, could have had Kylo and his Knights on the other side. 

Ah well, hopefully Disney learns from the mistakes and make a new trilogy (new setting, characters etc). Else they can take the George route and just sit on it and sell merchandise and add stuff to the OT that nobody asked for.
