I remeber reading a comic at least a year and a half or two years ago with Luke's ex students becoming the knights of Ren. It was Disney approved so that's the backstory I assumed to be true. 

The fact they ret conned it again, and made it dumber to make a few hundred thousand in comic books sales is disappointing but not surprising.
