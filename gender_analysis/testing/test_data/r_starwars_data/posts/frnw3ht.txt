It’s astounding to me how poorly the sequel trilogy was handled in general.  You have 3 movies, one is going to come out every two years.  You have all the time and money you want to get a complete story put together in 3 acts, assemble the right writing team, and write a solid roadmap so you can knock it out of the park.  But nope, let’s Leroy Jenkins this fuckin thing and see what happens.
