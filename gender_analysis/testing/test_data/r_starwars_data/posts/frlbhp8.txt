I think it’s pretty cool to get to use a lightsaber more than any other non-Jedi/Sith/Kylo character. He was still very important in TLJ and only got pushed to the side in TROS for Poe’s sake. And that’s okay. He was still pretty important. The claim that all he does is yell Rey’s name may be the dumbest criticism I’ve consistently heard. He does it what, four times? One of which is in a very powerful scene (Takodana). Just ignore all the other things he does
