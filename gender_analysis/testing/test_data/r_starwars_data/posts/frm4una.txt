I disagree. TFA already showed their disdain for Finn before any deadline crunches set in.

In TFA, they already start using Finn as comic relief and cheerleader the minute he's flying with Poe.

He gets a great introduction as the traumatized soldier dealing with Phasma etc as part of Kylo's highly trained personal guard and then he's bumbling and whooping his way across Jakku.

Look at how they have him be a janitor at the end of the movie. So suddenly his assignment to Phasma's crew makes no sense.

TFA set up Finn for failure.
