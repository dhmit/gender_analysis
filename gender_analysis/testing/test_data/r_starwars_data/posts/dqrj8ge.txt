Well put. There is absolutely no way to justify that the Sith are not evil. The entire purpose of their order is to see the strong subjugate the weak by any means necessary. I used to think otherwise until I delved more into the EU. The Jedi are totally the good guys and their rules, though extreme in some cases, are there for a reason.
