He shouldn't have been a Jedi. He shouldn't have been marketted with a lightsaber. You don't have to be a Jedi, sith, or force user in star wars to be a kick ass character. He was under utilized and I agree he was wasted, they really let his character down. So much potential, john boyega was fantastic.
