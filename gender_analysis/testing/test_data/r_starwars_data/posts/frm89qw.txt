Interesting? I would have been interesting in the original trilogy. Like after the rebellion destroys 2 death stars and kills the emporer no shit there's gonna be some defections.

I mean the existence of the First Order is the interesting question not why people are saying "why are we still killing babies for discount Darth Vader over here?"
