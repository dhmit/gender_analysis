Well first off, Lego is almost never thrown out but is rather constantly recycled between owners so it has a lesser impact than, say, plastic bottles. 


Anyways actually yes, Lego is currently working on a plan to switch their pieces to be made of sustainable plant-based plastic, hopefully being rolled out in the next decade or so.
