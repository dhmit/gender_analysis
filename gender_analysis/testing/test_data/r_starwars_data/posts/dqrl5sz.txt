The Jedi rules didn't *cause* the visions, they just stopped him from being able to seek help from the Jedi.

Even if he went to the Jedi for help. They couldn't do anything to help. Maybe, at most they can help deduce that the visions are false. Anakin probably doesn't trust them and goes to Palpatine anyway.
