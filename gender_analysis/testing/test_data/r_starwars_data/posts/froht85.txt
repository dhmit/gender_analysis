It was JJ that wanted to be that next George Lucas till he realized how much work it took and dipped out after making one movie.

Rian was much more amenable to listening to others inputs and worked very closely with the story group to make sure that the plot made sense canonically. Rian didn’t want to do XI because he still wanted to make smaller scale films like Knives Out.

JJ ignored the story group completely and said fuck it and that’s how we ended up with TROS. 

KK tried to get someone to do the whole thing but they didn’t have enough time/the people she did ask weren’t interested. This is entirely Disney and Bob Igers fault, he had to be *begged* for the December 2015 release date, it was supposed to come out that May. 

According to JJ and KK there was an outline. According to Rian there wasn’t one. At this point it doesn’t matter anymore, as at this point I’m not really trusting anything that comes out of Jeffrey Jacobs mouth concerning the overarching production of the trilogy.
