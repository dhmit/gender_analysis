Finn is Force-Sensitive. This was confirmed by a fan who approached J.J during the premiere and asked what Finn was going to tell Rey that never got in the film, which was that he is force-sensitive. Unforetunately, the film screwed up and we never saw Finn actually start to train in the ways of the Jedi. (Though I hope he does in future films, if it were to happen.)
