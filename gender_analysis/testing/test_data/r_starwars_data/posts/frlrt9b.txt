The Sith troopers and the crews of the ~~lazy~~ Xystan Star Destroyers were members of the Sith Cultists who had been on the planet for generations. They were born and raised there and were also the ones who built the ships.

And they had already had a large portion of the galaxy including several major shipyards under their control prior and had been recruiting willing members who missed the days of the Empire
