It felt out a little out of place and a little too much (comes across more like a gag reel) but they could have done a slightly more serious take and left it in no problem.

I swear the sequel trilogy is scattered with lots of good story bits that are never followed up on or connected to anything.  I'll never understand their decision to have no plan.
