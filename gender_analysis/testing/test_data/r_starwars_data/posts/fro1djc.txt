You realize there's still half a movie after Canto Bight, right? Why would you introduce a theme lightly in TLJ if you're not going to explore it in your own film? This is the most absurd defense I've ever seen of this movie. "Rian set up slavery, moral grayness, and corruption as themes and did nothing with them in his own movie but it's JJ's fault". Finn has no arc in TLJ. He doesn't learn anything. He goes from wanting to do a dangerous mission in Canto Bight to wanting to do a dangerous mission after Cantk Bight. If I learned about the Resistance buying from the FO's vendors, I'd cool my jets. Probably talk to Leia. Probably mention it to anybody. But Finn shuts his trap and never mentions it again for the rest of the movie. It's literally the biggest waste of time ever and could've been edited out and it wouldn't have affected the story at all.
