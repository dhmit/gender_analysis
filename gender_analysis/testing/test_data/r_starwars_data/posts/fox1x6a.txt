I’m genuinely confused right now. I think that people don’t know this is an official LEGO set and think that it’s custom..? Definitely a lot of people quickly scrolling by and thinking he just built this out of nowhere, 30k upvotes for an official LEGO set is just odd. Maybe it just seems more impressive to people who don’t know much about LEGO.
