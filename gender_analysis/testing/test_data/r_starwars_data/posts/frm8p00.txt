You're exactly right. The EU was massively expanded by the PT. Yeah some things got retconned or scrapped because the PT changed it up, but ultimately it introduced so many new settings, characters, factions, etc. that it set up a bunch of new stories in the EU.

The ST on the other hand *massively* constricts the Star Wars universe. First, it scrapped the old EU entirely (which didn't really bother me, honestly) so all of the world building that happened there is gone. Then it gave almost zero information on the state of the galaxy. There's hardly anything to jump off of to go tell a new story from. And lastly, it had a chilling effect on the new EU because it limited what stories could be told, because the trilogy hadn't been written and fleshed out. So all you could write were little filler stories and side tales that don't materially impact anything.
