I mean, yeh kinda? But also no. Everyone having the potential to feel the force has always been a thing. "It surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together." Force sensitivity is just as much a state of mind, as it is a power?. And it is as much a power as it is a disembodied god with it's own will. Look at Chirrut, he had no formal training, wasn't identified as force sensitive by the Jedi. Yet, he evidently subconciously harnessed the force/was influemced by its will.

As for Finn and co'. It's not saying that their is an entire Stormtrooper platoon that can use Force push. But it does make sense that when an organisation is kidnapping children on mass, they would be picking up a few force sensitive children here n' there. And it makes sense that it would be much harder to brainwash them.
