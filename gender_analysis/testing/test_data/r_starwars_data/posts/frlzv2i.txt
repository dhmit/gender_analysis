I mention it slightly in a reply to a comment in this thread......But I personally think Kathleen Kennedy has been a death blow to the Star Wars Universe.

The “creative” control she has taken with the sequels as well as the decisions on the IP outside the movies, while not all bad there, has been almost entirely horrible.

I feel like there are so many SW veterans out there that would roast her to death if they weren’t contractually bound to say nice things about Disney and their version of Star Wars as a whole.
