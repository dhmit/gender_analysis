I expected Finn to have equal billing with Rey, with Kylo and Poe as supporting characters.

Personally, Finn and Rey should have ended up together, which is why I was pleasantly surprised to see them seemingly foreshadowing this in TROS (Rey has firmly rejected Kylo, Finn has *something important* to tell Rey but is hesitant), I figured he was holding onto a declaration of love and that they would have grown close over the gap between TLJ and TROS. 

Even better if they discover he's force sensitive and she starts training him as a Jedi. They could have founded a New Jedi Order together.
