Man, I’m not usually the type of person to judge movies based on being good or bad, most of the time it’s just a “fun” movie for me.

Nothing made sense, it was from here to there to here to there then this happened, the end. There were no cutoffs, no wrap ups for any of the characters. And don’t even get me started on the fucking ending
