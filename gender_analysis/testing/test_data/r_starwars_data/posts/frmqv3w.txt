I actually thought the idea was to “split” Luke skywalker between 4 characters when the original marketing came out 

What if Rey was the one that had the force but was shit with a lightsaber so Finn became the lightsaber guy. And then you had Poe as the ace pilot.
And kylo would be the one with the familial drama and struggle with the dark side.
And then you had all three working together in fight scenes against kylo .

I thought that’s a really cool way of bonding a team and not having any one character be too powerful 

...boy was I wrong
