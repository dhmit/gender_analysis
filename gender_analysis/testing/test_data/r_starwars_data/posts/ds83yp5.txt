I am not calling it galaxy breaking because it doesn't make sense, because it does. I am calling it galaxy breaking because it is so OP that if it could happen that it would have been happening all the time in the other movies and it didn't so there must be some reason it couldn't. It doesn't fit with the rest of the series.
