AND THEY ROBBED HIM OF ON-SCREEN ADMISSION HE CAN FEEL THE FORCE. The IMPLIED version really pisses me off.

Remotely feeling Rey's death; talking to Jannah about the Force; wanting to tell Rey while sinking in the sand; sequences with Han (like suggesting using the Force to infiltrate Starkiller Base); surviving his lightsaber injury so easily; etc. â€” these ALL laid the PERFECT foundation to reveal Finn as Force Sensitive and then make REY AND FINN be the Dyad in the Force against KYLO REN.

In my opinion, they should've either had Kylo destroy Palpatine, or join him LOYALLY, for tricking him with Snoke, and take, or use, his fleet properly â€” and then pit Rey and Finn against the Final Order in a real, Duel of Fates-on-steroids, final battle for the Force. They even could've kept the "Rey Palpatine" arc; had Rey fall to the Dark Side and join Kylo [and maybe even Palpatine]; and then have Finn redeem REY and bring HER back to the Light Side in the end (placing the emphasis on the fact that family doesn't just have to be blood-relation; I'm getting-at basically reversing Palpy's comments on "Vader saved Luke; the only family you have here is me" thing).

Yet, no, they destroyed a perfectly good, potential arc. We could've had a returned Palps; Kylo becoming what Vader was SUPPOSED to be; Leia's and Luke's sacrifices being worth mourning; a heartfelt bond between characters that WASN'T shmultzy and forced to be "romantic;" and the best fight sequence ever (and a closure to the imagery of the Force ripping that fissure between a damaged Kylo, a vicious Rey, and a broken Finn in the last fight scene on Starkiller Base).

But I digress. ðŸ˜‚ Finn was just one of the only characters I really felt I could connect to in the ST; he had SO much potential depth and they turned him into a clown that just screams, "REEEEYYYYYYY!!!!" every five minutes. Really did his character, and the actor, a huge disservice.

Edit: For clarity.
