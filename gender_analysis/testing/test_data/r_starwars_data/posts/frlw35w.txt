You just summed up the entire last three movies. "Hey you know what would have actually made this interesting or added some semblence of a cohesive plot or character development or fucking SOMETHING? YOU KNOW, LITERALLY ANYTHING BESIDES RANDOM SHIT HAPPENING ON AND ON FOR THREE HOURS???" God dammit how the fuck does a multi-million dollar franchise create such a dud of a film, three times. I can't take it any more. They got their money and I guess that's all that matters.
