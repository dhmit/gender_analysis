No problem. So I had to do some research because it made me curious and it actually isn't a quote from him but does put across the same sentiment.

If you haven't seen Parks and Rec, his character Ron Swanson is the cookie cutter "manly man". Outdoors man, good with his hands, doesn't let his emotions show, etc. His character is often pointed to as what "being a man" is, so Offermans actual quote, and the idea that the original person you replied to, is really more to stress that the idea we have shaped that a man doesn't show his emotions is wrong and that it's more manly to be able to express yourself without worrying about what people think. 

I don't personally think Offerman or the poster we're trying to exclude portions of humanity, I just think they were directly speaking towards the implied image of the manly man and trying to break it down and humanize it. As a man who doesn't capture any of the traits in the "manly man" image I really like his quote because it's shattering stereotypes and expectations. I can definitely see how it can make some feel excluded though but with the context in the article I linked I do not get the feeling that was intended in any way due to the context of the scenario. I can't speak for the person you replied to but I give them the benefit of the doubt.
