>Well your insistence on using other peopleâ€™s statements as proof

What are you even talking about? *He's the one* that claimed "the community" agreed with him. So it's wrong for me to cite community examples that disprove his claims?

>failing to conjure up your own examples

I was never asked to give examples of my person experience. But you probably should have been able to predict what they were based on my comments. It's not a hard leap to make.

And oh look, np.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/d0hmpu/made_it_to_the_guinness_book_of_world_records_2020/ez9zk5f/

Here's another user giving *actual examples* and evidence for what I (we) are saying about this, and still getting downvoted regardless. It's almost as if there are just a bunch of petty fanboys in this sub that don't even play the game they are jerking off over.
