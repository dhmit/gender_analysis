And why is taking power evil? We all die, pretty are killed by predators. Stars collapse and explode giving life to after destroying everything in it vicinity. It's a vicous cycle.

You see the Sith through moral eyes, what you seem right and wrong based on a concept of life and death, with the emphasis on the prior because you are alive.

One could say that the weak hold back the strong, the vibrant life that chooses with free will to continue on. The Jedi held into old dead views which allowed the utter destruction of entire planets, their apathy killed trillions.

And the sith have a darker order, but it's still order. A master takes an apprentice to guide them, to teach them, and never let them rest on their own laurels. Sure most are corrupted by power, but that doesn't mean the dark side is bad, merely the over influence of power and emotion can be.

Then again dark side =\= Sith so maybe we'll see more of the dark Jedi path, or the balance like Mace Window wanted.
