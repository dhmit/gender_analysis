Everyone is connected to the force. Some are more sensitive to it, but lack the ability to manipulate it. Towards the end of the republic its heavily implied that the jedi had lost much of the power they once held. Personally I think that's because there were too many Jedi all pulling from the same well. That's why the force needed balanced and why the dark side users were disproportionately stronger. There were a LOT of Jedi before the fall of the Republic and it stands to reason that's because there are a lot more force sensitive's out there that could make that leap.
