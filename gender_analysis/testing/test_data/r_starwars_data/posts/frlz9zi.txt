I don't know man, when the weight of the entire galaxy is on your shoulders and you're the only one who's able to bring the Jedi back, but then your nephew (who your sister and best friend trusted you with) and his friends betray you by murdering your other Padawans and burning your temple down, you might be pretty traumatized. 


It's weird, I feel like there's another Jedi who went into isolation after his apprentice betrayed him and killed Jedi, but I can't think of his name.
