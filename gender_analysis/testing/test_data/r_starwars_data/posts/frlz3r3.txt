Nevermind that Finn should have already have been EXTREMELY well acquainted with this given his backstory.

The whole arc feels very low impact too. Watching it, it didn't even feel like the characters were really affected by the events unfolding. It just kind of happened and then they went back to the real plot as if it hadn't.
