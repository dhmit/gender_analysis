Probably going to get a lot of hate for this, but I think everyday people are just as great in what they do as celebrities. Many people are totally selfless and never get recognized for it, such as the good teachers we've all had. I think it would be good to thank everyone for their work towards bettering the world, including celebrities (who can model good or bad behavior for many people to see). But don't forget the people around you..
