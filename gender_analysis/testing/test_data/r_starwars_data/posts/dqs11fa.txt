This was what always bothered me about Star Wars. The original films were always clearly just "good vs evil" in the most white hat/black hat way possible. There wasn't anything wrong with that in itself, but later when the universe expanded and they started giving us more in depth looks at Jedi and their culture it became rather infuritating seeing obviously flawed people and decisions being presented as if they were the epitome of nobility.

 The biggest flaw in Knights of the Old Republic to me was not being able to call out the various Jedi characters on their sanctimonious bullshit, while "evil" Sith characters were just dickbags to everyone even when it made no sense for them to be.

I've always loved the more complex idea that the story presented in Star Wars wasn't just Good vs Evil, but a tragedy showing how flaws in the Jedi's philosophy lead to their own destruction.
