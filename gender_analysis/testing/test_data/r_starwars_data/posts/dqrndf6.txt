[Insert popular reddit TIL about John Cena owning the Guiness World Record for most Make-A-wish visits]

But yeah, i havent watched wrestling in decades, but i have nothing but the utmost respect for people like John Cena, who does so much work outside of the ring to bring happiness to dying kids and his fans. The world needs more people like him and Mark.
