I was also thinking that the Jedi were, either intentionally or not, culling force sensitives from the galaxy. We see with the Skywalker lineage that force sensitivity is strongly genetic, but the Jedi pick out force sensitives at a young age and don't allow them to have relationships and children. With them gone there's probably more force sensitives now than there have been in several decades.
