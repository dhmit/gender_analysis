I had a symphony conductor with this once. He had to explain to us the first day what it was , and that he wasnâ€™t just asking for vibrato all the time. 

He was super upbeat about it, and was really inspirational to see him be one of the best directors in the nation despite having tremors in his hands while his whole job revolves around using his hands to convey emotion.
