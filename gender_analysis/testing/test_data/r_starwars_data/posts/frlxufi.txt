I didn’t care if Finn was a Jedi, but I did want his character to show that you don’t have to be a Jedi to wield a “civilized weapon” and that anyone can be a hero. He was stolen and brainwashed as a child but rose up to be able to fight with a saber like the “heroes of old.” Proof that anyone - even someone without a name - can be important.
