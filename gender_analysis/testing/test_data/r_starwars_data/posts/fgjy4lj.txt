... and it completely screws the soundtrack.

I get why they felt those sequences were useful (explaining how Vader got from Cloud City to the Star Destroyer), but it's one of those things where you should be able to trust the audience to fill in the gaps.

My favourite fun fact about that sequence: [they only built the left side of the Star Destroyer bridge set](https://imgur.com/a/MTa7Q) (and then only the crew pit, some walkways, and a couple of arches - the rest is matte paintings). So when the officers and Vader are all clustered by the side window, the shots are reversed (most noticeable from the rank badges). I suspect so it balances the shots inside the Millennium Falcon cockpit.
