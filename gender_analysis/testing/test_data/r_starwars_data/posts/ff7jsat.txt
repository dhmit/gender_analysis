Get a very thin blade and slice slowly down the part you want illuminated, after that, get yourself some 99% isopropyl alcohol & green dye, then grab a cotton swab and apply it on the now created slice. After it’s all dried up, get a chisel and a good-name brand hammer(NO CHEAP SHIT) & start going at it lightly, when you’re done, throw your phone in the blender and put it on “liquify” for 4 seconds. Gather all the blended parts & throw it in some lemon lime koolaid. Boom. Done. Congratulations.
