I believe he is currently a consultant who they ask for ideas. However, if they don’t like his ideas or only use part of them, he can’t do anything about it. My understanding is that if they ask for help he is happy to but they kind of use him and then throw him away. I’ll be interested to see if they work with him more on the future projects.
