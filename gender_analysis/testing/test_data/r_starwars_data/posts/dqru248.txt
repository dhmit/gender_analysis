Faction - Primary (Secondary)

---

**Rebels - Neutral Good (none)** ... I see little evidence for the rebels being chaotic at all. Just because they're fighting against a lawful force does not mean that they are not lawful themselves. 

**Jedi - Neutral Good (Lawful Good)** ... the Jedi believe in balance, which is not necessarily a neutral thing, as perfect balance lies in good. They follow their tenets faithfully and are honest individuals, which makes me put them towards lawful.

**Sith - Lawful Evil (Neutral Evil)** ... though there are exceptions, the Sith system is notoriously hierarchical and artificial. It is very constructed and consists of lawful components.

**Bounty Hunters - True Neutral (Chaotic Neutral)** ... definitely leaning to the chaotic side, but not primarily as it is the *values and ideas* of bounty hunters which define their alignment. Not all bounty hunters want to see a lawless and crazy galaxy. Many just want to make money however possible.
