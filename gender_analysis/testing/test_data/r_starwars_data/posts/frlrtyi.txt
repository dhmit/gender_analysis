Jedi searching for force users is super simple when you factor in the quick bloodwork/midichlorian test from Phantom Menace. Baby gets born, their blood is tested automatically, of they've got a high midichlorian count there's a little flag made in their paperwork, and a few days later a nice Jedi, or an Imperial agent shows up with a pamphlet asking if you've heard the good word.

Obi-wan did the test on a diplomatic yacht, which suggests the test is either really easy or so common that it's a part of basic medical technology.
