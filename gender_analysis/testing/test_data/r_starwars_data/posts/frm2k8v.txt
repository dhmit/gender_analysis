I thought it was "Ghouls", and looking at Wookieepedia that is indeed the case.

 I also learned that The Knights of Ren weren't only under Kylo Ren, but instead the guy that helped turn Ben into Kylo Ren. Snoke was like "Hey, join these Knights of Ren", who was led by a guy named Ren... who wielded a lightsaber, uh... also named "The Ren". The Knights, and Kylo through this, follow an ideology based on this lightsaber. Somehow. 

>"You don't follow me, friend. You follow this. The Ren. The Ren doesn't stop to worry about what it's burning or the right or wrong of it, or the goals it might achieve. The Ren just is. It lives, and it consumes, and it doesn't apologize. It is its nature and nothing else. I believe in that principle on a deep, deep level. In fact, I've dedicated my life to it."
