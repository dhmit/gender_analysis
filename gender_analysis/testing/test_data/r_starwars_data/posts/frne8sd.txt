I legit thought that he and Phasma were going to have an EPIC showdown. Starts off looking pretty even, oddly enough - but that's because Phasma is definitely hurt from surviving. As the fight continues, we see her growing stronger and more determined. This is General Fucking Phasma! She's not going to let a mutinous little Trooper beat her!

She's got the upper hand now, making Finn scramble for anything. He manages to get a good shot in, forcing her to rip her helmet off, showing us her face. There's rage in her eyes, unstable rage. Finn is frozen, we start to hear a thumping sound getting louder and louder as Phasma charges him, ready for the finishing blow. Finn is against a wall, the heartbeat getting louder and louder, drowning everything out. She's so close now...

Suddenly, everything goes silent, and just as she's about to strike, he screams and puts his hands up to protect himself, and force blasts Phasma away. We see Phasma landing hard on her front, being flipped through the air. When she looks up, for the first time, we see fear in her eyes. We pan to Finn, who steps away from the wall, puts his hand out, and is able to call a weapon to him.

They're on even playing field now. Phasma struggles to her feet, as Finn starts to run forward, determination and strength renewed as a Jedi.
