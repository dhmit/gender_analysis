I hate that people call Luke whiney. He's nowhere near anakin level, despite being brought up in basically the same circumstances.

Luke actually lives up to his destiny, despite hardships and setbacks.

We don't deserve Hamill, but we do deserve Ford (I'm not sitting on the man, but his attempts to disown his most loved characters has always grated on me a little)
