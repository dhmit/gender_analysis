I agree full heartedly to the Kylo Ren comment. When I initially saw the character design I was pretty down with the concept of a Vader stand in, but then the helmet came off, and instead of being menacing, it was more like watching a telekinetic toddler throw a tantrum every time he was on screen.

Rogue one did it right, imho, it was in close proximity too the saga, and ties in well, but didn't seem forced. It took a small snippet from the OT, and expands on it. I never really thought about how the Alliance got the plans for the deathstar aside from 'it was stolen by spies, and they died to get it'.

The Mandalorian is great for a lot of reasons. They crafted their own story out of starwars lore, completely unrelated too the Skywalkers (only time will tell, i suppose.) I am particularly impressed with how they have depicted the remnants of the Empire. This is more or less how I would expect a recently defeated Galaxy wide military to react. Holed up in some backwater, trying to reestablish their sphere of influence. Still fairly well equipped, but disheveled and decentralized.

This is the kind of content I would like to see more of.
