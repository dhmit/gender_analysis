My thought is that Palpatine and all his unknown number of clones created an unbalance in the dark side of the force, so the force retaliated by creating a LOT of force sensitives in the direction of the light. 

Also, my theory is that direct children of force sensitive users are by birth more force sensitive, so a grandchild, like Rey or Kylo Ren, would be powerful enough to learn advanced techniques quickly.
