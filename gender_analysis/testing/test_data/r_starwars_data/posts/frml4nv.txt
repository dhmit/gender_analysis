I believe they hint at his sensitivity in episode 7.

On jakku, in the Falcon after they defeat the tie fighters; Rey and Finn celebrate asking each other how they ‘did that’ and they both kind of say I don’t know.

I always took that as they both had Jedi reflexes. Might be an overestimatation though on my part
