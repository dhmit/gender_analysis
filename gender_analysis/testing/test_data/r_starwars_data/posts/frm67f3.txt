I am a person who really wanted the movies to be good. 



I dont even remotely understand how you throw away an entire franchise like that.



They fuxking threw anakin Skywalkers entire sacrifice down the toilet without a single word and just brought palpatine in and said smoke wasnt shit.



The world building and storytelling was so bad it physically hurt my soul. 



I loved finn a d wanted something out of his character
