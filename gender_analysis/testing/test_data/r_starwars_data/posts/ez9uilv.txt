Yeah, most of the awards would have been given ironically.

By the time the comment gained traction across reddit, the community managers would have already realized that a shitstorm was coming, and it's unlikely they would have thought they could stop it just by buying themselves a few awards and pointing at those to justify the comment. 
Also, if that(mass awarding their own posts) was a standard procedure for them, it would probably happen a lot more across reddit, but i've never seen it occur in the subreddits that have presence from EA community managers.
