Spoken like a true SW sheep. You’re the type of person that will blindly buy anything with “Star Wars” slapped on it and the reason Disney is milking what was a great franchise. Fans like you who are so blind to see that your precious films have gone to shit but will still keep your head buried in the sand because of your nostalgia for the franchise. Grow up, the golden age of Star Wars is gone and will never return until Disney pawns it off (which will never happen).
