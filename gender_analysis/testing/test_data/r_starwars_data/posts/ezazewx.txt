I read EA’s comment and on the surface I agree with them. You SHOULD have to put in a grind to unlock a character like Vader. That’s how it would have been in the old days (sure maybe there was a cheat code instead of micro transaction. But if you didn’t know the code you had to keep playing). If EA is guilty of anything it’s taking advantage of the ‘instant gratification’ culture of today. Staying in business is hard and you have to monetise where you can. Maybe the issue is with players thinking they are entitled to have everything they want immediately. 

Now if EA ONLY made certain characters available through purchase, that would be a different story. And I would come down hard on them. Correct me if I’m wrong and tell me if they did in fact do that. I have not played the game. Just my first reaction from this one statement they made. Tell me if I’m out of line or missed something here...
