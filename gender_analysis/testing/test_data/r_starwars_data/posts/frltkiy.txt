And here you highlight the main problems with episode 8 and 9.  Episode 8 basically ignored all the canon and just did their own thing.  Episode 9 ignored the emotional connection to the canon and tried to do something interesting with the canon but ended up basically shitting on it as well.

I am pretty sure the end up episode 8 was going for exactly what you just stated.   Everyone has the force.   Or at least a shit ton more people do.   At least episode 9 reversed that and went back to force sensitivity was an important genetic thing and who your parents are was everything.

Kylo Ren was the saving grace of episode 8 in my mind but episode 8 is by far my least favorite of all 9.
