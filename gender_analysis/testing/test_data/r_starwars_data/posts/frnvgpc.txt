I honestly believe that the writers caved to all the shitty right-wing crybabies who were upset about all the “PC/SJW pandering” in the new series. They couldn’t do much about the female-protagonist rage, but they could do something about the black stormtrooper rage. Pandering to the anti-change crybabies ruins everything.
