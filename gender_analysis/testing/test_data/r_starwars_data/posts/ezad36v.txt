Yeah I remember when the fiasco happened, I don't even like Star Wars but I made sure to downvote it, and I very rarely downvote things that I even have an informed opinion against.

EA really fucked up with greed and then doubled down acting like they were doing gamers a favor at the same time. It's probably one of the most tone deaf and insulting things I've seen from PR of a major company.
