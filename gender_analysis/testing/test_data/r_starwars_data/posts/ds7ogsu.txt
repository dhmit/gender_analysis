>  In any of them you can ask the question, "well why can't they smash a ship into it really quickly?"

Yes, and you can abstain and not let it ruin the immersion by letting it remain one of those myriad of unaddressed details we are implicitly asked to trust "doesn't work" for some science/tech reasons, not explained to us...

Now however, some writer went and changed that, and showed that actually in the SW universe, a rather crappy ship can be used as a FTL weapon to blow up what is likely one of the biggest and best armed ships in the FO fleet... 

Then that breaks that immersion, because suddenly we got a writer shouting in our face "btw FTL-weapons work in the SW universe!" - and that means they should rightfully be all over the SW universe, since FTL-weapons are some of the most powerful weapons imaginable... and they aren't - Which leads to the obvious conclusion that this writer responsible for this wrote some pretty shitty sci-fi.

Quite obviously, they were way to focused on turning General Purple Hair into yet another *Noble Sacrifice* rather than keeping the story in line with established lore... then again, we're speaking about a writer who thought "someone need to steer the ship" was a good excuse for General Purple Hair (and the generals who died one by one on the ships that ran out of fuel as well?) to stay on the ship, because apparently making ship a decent ship AI that can drive in a straight line is way to hard in an universe where kids build sentient robots out of scrap...
