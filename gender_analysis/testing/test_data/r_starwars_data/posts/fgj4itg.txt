The problem of that is that it incites more flame wars than paleontologists arguing over whether a dinosaur had feathers or etymologists arguing over the origins of a word. Plus, some stuff in legends is too wonderful to discard, so the better solution is to leave canon up to the individual to decide. 


Disney basically tossed the baby out with the bath water and threw away far too much of the worthwhile elements in my opinion. So official canon is not for me.
