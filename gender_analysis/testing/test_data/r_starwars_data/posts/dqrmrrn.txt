It never made sense to me why Mark is such a great guy, with all these amazing stories, but his career seemed to dry up for a bit. 

I hope he gets some other work besides CW shows and Luke in the future. I really enjoy his work, and I know he retired from working as the Joker VO, but man was he the best.
