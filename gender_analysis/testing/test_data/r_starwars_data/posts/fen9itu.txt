After the shitshow the sequel films were, I am glad to see Lucas visibly involved with a new Star Wars project.

His active involvement explains why people are so in love with the show. The fact that Favreau and Filoni find Lucas' involvement crucial makes me very happy. I hope they get better positions at LucasFilm in the future.
