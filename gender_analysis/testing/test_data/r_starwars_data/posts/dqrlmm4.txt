I suppose we could consider those things, just like anyone who mentions the "starving kids in Africa" every time someone throws out uneaten food or something along those lines. But at the end of the day, I think people just do the best they can. In this case, it's just a story about someone who got lucky making a request on behalf of their friend. The end result ultimately is what matters here, I would say.

Aside from that, there are a lot of stories out there about celebrities or whoever making appearances to sick children in hospitals or doing great things for others. I don't think there's any unrealistic expectations set out as a result, and Mark's been known for doing quite a few things for random people and kids anyway. This is just one in the bucket.
