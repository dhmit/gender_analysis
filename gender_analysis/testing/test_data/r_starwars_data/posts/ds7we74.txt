Nah, they've done the space station, the planet conversion, the only way they can top that is to convert an entire solar system into super weapons aimed at the entire galaxy (A kind of "If we don't win, everyone loses" kind of deal).

I'd love to see how the incompetent and decimated Resistance manages to save a handful of planets and get everyone else killed because of stupid management decisions and getting in the way of another heroic sacrifice...
