Hinted or confirmation bias? I mean for all we know chad Jar Jar Binks went full Genghis Khan and his seed causes people to defect.

It probably went like, Finn sitting at a stormtroopers camp just chilling. Sith Binks comes in and starts screaming "Mesa wants you-sa face full with big doo-doo". Jar Jar moves on to his next target, but the seed has been planted. Finn's brain is now vulnerable for triggers that allow him to defect.

As Binks doesn't know when to stop he probably infected thousands of Stormtroopers. He didn't do it on purpose though because a bumbling frog doesn't know what he's doing.
