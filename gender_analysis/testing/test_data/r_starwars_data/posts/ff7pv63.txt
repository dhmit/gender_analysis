I’d hazard a guess that it’s not purely coincidental and that it may have been to do with something like “no wait look! There ARE purple lightsabers, it’s not JUST for Mace Windu!”

Having said that, didn’t Samuel L Jackson say that he would only appear in Star Wars at all if he had a purple lightsaber? 

Meaning that since he was in episode 1 this would have already been agreed? 

It is a fun thing to think about though
