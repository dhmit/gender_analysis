Luke not appearing to Kylo was criminal. Iâ€™ll never understand that Han scene. Is Kylo hallucinating? Why is it his dad? TFA establishes they have very little contact after Kylo went with Luke. It should have been his former master and uncle who was partially responsible for his turn to the dark side.
