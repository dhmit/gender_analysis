I've never heard a bad thing said about Mark Hamill. Where other actors when on to be critical of their roles and the franchise itself, Mark embraced it, despite the fact that he was pretty heavily typecast for years afterward. The amount of love he has for the fans is why he's easily one of my favorite people on the planet.
