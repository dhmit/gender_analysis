They ruined Finn, I was so excited to see him when I first walked into the theater, a storm trooper turned Jedi was awesome and John Boyega seemed like a really great actor. After walking out I was kinda disappointed but still thought his character had promise to become a Jedi, only for TLJ to take a shit on that.
