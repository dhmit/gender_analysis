.......why are people saying stuff like this and getting so many upvotes. Finn was an awesome character. One of my favorites and he wasnt unimportant in any of the movies. Why are people so focused on what he isnt? Instead of focusing on what he is?

Does nobody want to talk about how his character arc is so broad that he completely beat out he stormtrooper past? No? Does nobody want to talk about how hes one on the first non force users to fight with a lightsaber? Nah? Ou ok well then how about the fact the multiple times in the trilogy he was willing to lay down his life to save her friends and the resistance? No? You guys just wanna talk about how he wasnt a good character and he was under developed because he wasnt what you wanted him to be? Get out of here.

Believing that fin got less and less important as the trilogy went on says more about your preference than the actual character cause he got WAY more important.
