Doesn't have the VHS times though :)

Although with a VHS you'd have to do it manually since each persons tape will run at slightly different speeds that will make a not insignificant difference after around 2 hours.

edit: the center pieces of the tables at my bar mitzvah (in the mid 90s) were vhs trilogies of star wars, indiana jones, and back to the future. Not all 3 at one table, but one or the other at each table.
