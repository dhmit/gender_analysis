Plus, driving in Southern California is just kind of assumed. Like, even if Mark Hamill flew to this sick kid he would have to drive to the airport.

Unless ... does Mark Hamill have a private airport? Helipad even? I imagine there's a non 0% chance of that being a thing, so maybe it is possible he wouldn't have to drive. But in that case he'd then just take the helicopter to the kid, so again we're at a wash.
