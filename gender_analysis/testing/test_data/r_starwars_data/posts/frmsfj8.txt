Finn is the one you want to focus on here? Really? The entire new trilogy is a bunch of jokes. Yeah Finn got screwed, but so did every other character in the series. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewy, Rey, Obi Wan, Yoda, Maz, fucking EVERYONE. Leia dies because her son dies? That's the death you give the fans that you promised would bring her character closure? Luke's death is the death of the optimistic carrier of the original trilogy, the character that gave generations the embodiment of good? Fuck, Finn didn't only get shit on with not being a jedi. He should've died at the end of ep 8. The sacrifice he would've made if he died would've outweighed anything he did from that point on.

Also... The new generation of star wars 'heroes' are fucked. Poe: "guys, we're fucked. sorry." Lando: "Dude...really? Maybe not give up so soon?"

New generation wants to take over but has to be saved by previous? New generation wants to kill off the heroes of the past trilogy, but has to be saved by them? Come on. What's happened to Star Wars?

If you like the new movies, fine. Good on you. But they're garbage. They rely on the original to save them, all the while shitting on the legacy HANDED TO THEM!!!

Finn got fucked. Fine. Whatever.

Luke got fucked more, and fuck anyone that wants to be ok with that.
