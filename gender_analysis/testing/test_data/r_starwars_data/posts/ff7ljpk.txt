You’ve got sentinel and guardian mixed up there. Sentinels use yellow and guardians use blue.

Also, purple(ish) crystals did exist before Mace Windu.

Most prominently, Darth Bane in the year 1000 BBY (so 950 years before episode 1 give or take) had a purple lightsaber (it might officially be called indigo or violet or something). Darth Bane was also the Sith Lord to implement the “rule of two” into sith teachings, I believe.
