Yes, that's why the people with the most karma are all posting a lot. Or have been.

For comments specifically AskReddit is amazing though, you can easily have several 1000+ comments in a single thread, and if you try a little you can get at least one every day.

And if you look at karmalb.com you'll find that plenty of active AskReddit users are at the very top for comment karma.

A pretty insane example for quantity over quality was that pepsi_next dude though, he was posting a good 50-100 nsfw posts every single day and until he was banned stayed ahead or even with gallowboob just having 10-1000 upvotes each.
