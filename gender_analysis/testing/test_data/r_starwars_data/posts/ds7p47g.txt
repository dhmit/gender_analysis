That's the point - it's a *fuck* ton of damage... So why are this the first time we are seeing FTL-weapons in SW? 

FTL-weapons are so damn insanely OP they should be all over the place - not using they would be like bringing a knife to a nuke-fight. 

For example, why sacrifice a ton of bombers and fighters, to take out one single large ship, when apparently you could've just taken a hyperspace drive, placed it behind a melted down slug of scrap metal, and just aimed it at the ship, flipped the switch, and watch it go booom?
