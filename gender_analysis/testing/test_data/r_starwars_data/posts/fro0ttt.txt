Forget being a Jedi. Imagine Finn, kidnapped as a child and indoctrinated into being a slave soldier, says "To hell with this," and starts a one man crusade to find and liberate the FO's child soldier indoctrination camps and straight up hunting the insidious and utterly ruthless Captain Phasma who runs the program leading up to an ultimate confrontation on the level as any of the great Jedi/Sith fights, a fight that proves that regular beings can be just as bad ass as laser sword wielding space wizards. But no, instead we get Phasma being a jobber and Finn stuck as the comic relief sidekick to the worst written character since Jar Jar.

Good job.
