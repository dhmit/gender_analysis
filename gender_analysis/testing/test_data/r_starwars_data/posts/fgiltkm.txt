I remember playing that at a Chuck E Cheese once. My mom got me a big cup of tokens to play it, so I was able to play through the whole thing. Every kid around me got pissed because I was playing it the whole time. I failed at the very end and lost, though. Failed to blow up DS2. Every kid laughed at me for that and cheered.

Still was a fun game. Loved it.
