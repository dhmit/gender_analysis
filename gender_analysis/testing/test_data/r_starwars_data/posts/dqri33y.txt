when i was younger i thought the jedi embodied good, and the sith embodied evil. 

now i'm older and have a more mature mind. being devoid of emotion doesn't make you good. it makes you impassive and neutral, which can be just as bad as being evil if it serves your purpose. 

edit: since this is blowing up, i'd like to add the following comment. my comment regarding the jedi order, is based on their creed, exert from a reply i made below:

There is no emotion, there is peace. There is no ignorance, there is knowledge. There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. There is no death, there is the Force

although one of mace windu's disciples and younger jedi apparently started reciting this creed, which i agree with more, but is very different than the first idealogically.

Emotion, yet peace. Ignorance, yet knowledge. Passion, yet serenity. Chaos, yet harmony. Death, yet the Force

the original creed lead to things, from my perspective, like anakin not allowed to be married, because love is also a powerful emotion that could cloud his judgement, being devoid of wordly anchors was more important to the order than teaching the disciples how to control and segregate their emotions when performing their duties.
