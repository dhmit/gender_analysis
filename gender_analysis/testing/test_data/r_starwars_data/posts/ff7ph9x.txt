Obviously Darth Bane comes before Mace Windu in-universe, but I was curious if there were any characters with purple lightsabers prior to the real-world release of Attack of the Clones (which establish Mace Windu and purple sabers)? 

Looks like Darth Bane first appeared with a purple saber in issue #1 of “Jedi vs. Sith” which released in April 2001. Attack of the Clones released after that in May 2002, but filming would’ve began prior to it in June of 2000. So while it would’ve been known internally that Mace Windu would have a purple saber for Attack of the Clones when “Jedi vs. Sith” came out, “Jedi vs. Sith” seems to be the first time the public would’ve been exposed to canonical purple lightsabers, since the earliest promotional material for Attack of the Clones didn’t come out for another year (as far as I can tell).

I’d be curious to learn if Darth Bane had a purple saber because of the decision to give Mace Windu one in the upcoming movie, or if it was just a coincidence that the two came out so close to one another.
