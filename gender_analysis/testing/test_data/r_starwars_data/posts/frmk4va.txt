You nailed it. JJ made an event movie. The Return of Star Wars featuring Nostalgia. Great fun but no teeth. TRoS just gave more mystery boxes and a ton of macguffins. They shouldn’t have brought him back. After reading everything about Duel of the Fates they should have just riffed off of that. Maybe Treverrow wasn’t the right guy but it shouldn’t have been JJ.
