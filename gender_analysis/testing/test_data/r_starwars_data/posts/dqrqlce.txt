Think about how few Jedi “sons” there are. Most of them have unique last names due to lack of marriage and procreating. 

I can only think of Luke and maybe Ki Adi Mundis Harem. 

Apparently the force is also hereditary, as well as random. Now imagine the Jedi humping like rabbits thered be so many force users lol
