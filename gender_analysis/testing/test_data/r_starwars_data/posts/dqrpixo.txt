>Anakin was weak against attachments due to being naturally fearful. When something threatened those he loved, he would become deeply afraid of what would happen to them. And fear leads to anger...

This is a great point. Anakin's love is the selfish variety, whereas Luke demonstrates a pure love in a few different ways. For instance, what reason does he have to pursue the redemption of Vader? Even if he's his father, it's not like the guy has been there for him, and has in fact tried to kill him and his friends before.
