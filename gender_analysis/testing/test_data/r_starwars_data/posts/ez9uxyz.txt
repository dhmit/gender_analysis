The progression wasn't even *completely* random.

You opened the loot boxes for crafting parts, which you could use to craft or upgrade *any star card in the game.*

Then you got 3-4 RNG star cards (or other items). But the RNG were bonus items. The crafting parts were the real thing you were opening lootboxes for.

The whole fucking internet lost it's shit about the fact that *they misunderstood the system.*

Was it a good system? Fuck no. Was it as bad as they made it out to be? Fuck no.
