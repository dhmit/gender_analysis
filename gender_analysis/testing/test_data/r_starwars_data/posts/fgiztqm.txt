> Here is my modest theory: the Galaxy Far Far Away's ‘humans’ are in fact sentient hive  insects, organized around a single queen, a handful of fertile males,  and a horde of infertile female soldiers.  For parsimony’s sake, let’s  assume that Force sensitivity in this species is possessed by fertile  males and females, and that male actors used to represent non-Force  sensitive characters are actually representing infertile females.
