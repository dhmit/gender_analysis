Agreed. There was a great comic about the life of a Storm Trooper and his experiences. The Rebels killed his younger sister while trying to steal his family's water harvesting equipment so he joined the Empire to avenge her death. He legitimately viewed the Rebels as terrorists with no regard for civilian deaths if it benefited their cause because in his unique situation that's what he experienced and had no reason to think otherwise. Only after years of serving as a Stormtrooper did he start to question the Empire and that entire short journey was more meaningful to me than the whole recent trilogy.
