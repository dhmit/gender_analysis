I was always under the assumption growing up that Force sensitivity was a kind of genetic thing. You have it to some extent or you don't (or, I guess everyone has it, but most people have it to such a miniscule extent that it's irrelevant). That's why I never had an issue with the midi-chlorians explanation. It also made sense that in Star Wars: Galaxies, at least initially, only a few players would be pre-disposed to become Jedi. Or why Luke was somehow powerfully Force sensitive, or why...
