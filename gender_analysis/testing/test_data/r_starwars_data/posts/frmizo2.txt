When the force awakens was first scheduled for release I thought it would have been super cool if Fin had a parallel story with Kylo Ren. Fin an ex-storm trooper moves towards the light as Kylo moves towards the dark. Both fighting their respective turns, but this was way more thought and development than what we ever got for the sequels lol
