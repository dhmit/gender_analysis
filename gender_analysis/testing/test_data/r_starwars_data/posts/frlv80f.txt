They tried to MCU end war a little too much without substance. He should've been the equivalent of Black Panther pulling up with his Army. Landa should've pulled up with whatever they scrounged up from the remainder of the resistance/rebel fleets. A close up of 10ish MonCala ships jumping in or some shit would've been great to honor Admiral Ackbar. Instead we get Finn riding around on space horses.
