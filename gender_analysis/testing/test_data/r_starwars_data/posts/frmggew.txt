I mean you don't die that quickly in space. 

You don't immediately explode or die or whatnot - I think you get a good & uncomfortable 15-30 seconds before any serious harm starts happening and even after that you got a minute or two where medical attention might save you. Leia is out in recovery for a large part after so it's not like she just shrugs this off. 

I mean it's not like she gets fully submerged in lava and is able to just shrug that off and be in fighting shape after, I mean people would be so upset... Oh wait, Vader straight up does that and the most common reaction I've seen is "so awesome"

Flying in space doesn't bother me much. It's space, there's no gravity to consider. We frequently get Jedi drop from hundreds of meters and land perfectly save, I feel a minor pull towards a door in space is really such a leap.
