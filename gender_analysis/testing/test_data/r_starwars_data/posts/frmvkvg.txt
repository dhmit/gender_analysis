It's true. Actually, if you couldn't tell, JJ was setting up Finn to be a Jedi in SWROS. He had something to tell Rey and it was that he could feel the force, but that plot point kinda got lost in the chaos. Mainly this was supposed to be set up in SWTLJ, but Rian kinda blew that out along with several other things.
