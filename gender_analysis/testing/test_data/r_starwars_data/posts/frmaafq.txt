I felt like the way that Finn could’ve been best used was as a sort of “duality” to Rey, the way they tried to make Kylo Ren behave but didn’t quite succeed. 

Have Finn decide to follow the path of the Jedi, and discover that anyone can wield the Force if they believe in it. Have Rey be the one who is inherently gifted - very much like Anakin was - and suffers from hubris/pride because of it, while Finn has to struggle to become attuned to it and is held back by his violent, traumatic past but gains a deeper respect because of the challenge. All throughout, Kylo keeps reappearing as a villainous reminder of the dark side’s corrupting influence. By the end, both Rey and Finn are actualized as powerful Force users, but Rey becomes a morally grey/conflicted character because the Force is so natural to her that she can’t help but abuse its power, while Finn more closely follows the teachings of the Jedi Order as a means to focus and master his inner demons. Cue a huge battle where he and Kylo fight over (and with) Rey over which way she will be swayed, just the same way Palpatine and Obi Wan fought to corrupt/save Anakin. It’s meant to “rhyme”, after all.
