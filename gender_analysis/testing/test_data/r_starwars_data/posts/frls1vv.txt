TLJ opened a lot of cool doors, but behind all of those doors was the same bag of poo on fire that Rian had the audience stomp out.  It was like oh, I wonder how this will end up? Oh... We are doing something else now... Oh I wonder how... Oh nvm new plot point this should be... Okay, we are doing something else... Please slow down, please hash this out... Oh god now Luke went out like a bitch, wait HOW IS SHE MOVING ROCKS? DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE FORCE IS LITERALLY ABOUT MOVING ROCKS WITH YOUR MIND? HOLY SHIT PLEASE STOP.

there were 100 different things that, on their own, could have been cool ideas, but when they jumped from scene to scene without resolving anything it just became a mess.
