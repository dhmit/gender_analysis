This is a major criticism i have with the last jedi and rise of skywalker.  Only Rey mattered.  No one else did.  

The Last Jedi:
Rey saves the day with the force.

Rise of Skywalker:
Finn and Poe’s mission was ultimately worthless while Kylo and Rey killed Palpatine.  They devalued every other mission.

In a New Hope, R2 and C3PO were the lookouts and saved them from being crushed, luke and han saved leia, obi-wan saved them from the tractor beam and from Vader.

In Empire Strikes Back, Luke battled Vader, and Leia and Chewie tried to rescue Han.  

In Return of the Jedi, the space battle, the ground battle, and the battle between luke, vader, and the emperor was of equal importance.  Without the ground, the ships couldn’t get through the shield, without the space battle the 2nd death star would destroy everyone, and without the battle between luke, vader, and the emperor, the force would not be balanced.
