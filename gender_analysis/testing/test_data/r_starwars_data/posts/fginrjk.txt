I feel like I will die saying this, but the "let the past die" was said by the villain. The bad guy. The person who learned nothing from his past and suffered the most. Everyone else learned something from the past and succeeded. The entire point of the line is that we're supposed to disagree with it. Palpatine in the original trilogy tells Luke that it's his destiny to murder Vader and become a sith. It's not like people take his word for it. He was obviously wrong.
