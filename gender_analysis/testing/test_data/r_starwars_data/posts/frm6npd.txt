I actually don’t disagree with the point that there was a ton of potential after episode 7. But, like a facade, there wasn’t anything behind it. He either had no plan or didn’t sell the plan to those in charge. Either way, it was a failure that allowed the potential to be squandered. What was appealing to the eye turned out to have no substance to it.
