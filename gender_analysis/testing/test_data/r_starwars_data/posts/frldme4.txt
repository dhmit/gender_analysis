Maybe Rey should have been the stormtrooper. What if she was hidden somewhere but instead of Jakku it was somewhere the 1st Order was able to abduct her & make her into a trooper? She could have had some special reasoning made as to why she was picked up even though she was older than most children, like they witnessed some strange feat she performed. They wouldn't have to know she was Sidious's grand daughter. Being older would also explain her constant desire to find her parents rather than not remembering like most Stormtroopers. Also being a special case for the stormtrooper program would better explain Kylo Ren's anger when discovering it was Rey that was involved with Poe's escape & locating BB8. Fin could have been introduced as someone they bumped into on Jakku or an existing resistance fighter.
