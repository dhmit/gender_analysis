Can't tell if that's sarcasm or not, so *just* in case I'll leave this info.


No, Mark Wahlberg has a worse past than most of these guys getting allegations lately.

Dude beat the shit out of two old asian guys and called them racial slurs when he was a teen and drug dealer. He allegedly blinded one of the guys in one eye (this is debatable though from what I've seen). These two guys were not together, it was two different instances on the same day. First guy hit with a plank of wood, I believe, and knocked him out. Second guy is the eye guy. 

He also stalked and harassed a group of 12 year old black kids, again calling them racial slurs and assaulting them as they tried to get away. He then proceeded to harass the kid with his group on a number of other times.

Mark was a punk ass kid who did a lot of fucked up shit. But ultimately it shows how people *can* change. 

When I see a live leak video of some thug kids doing some terrible shit, and all the replies are "these animals should be locked up for life", I just have to refrain from that, even if what I'm seeing is terrible. Because some people have insanely fucked up childhoods and know nothing else. It doesn't matter the race, this happens with teens in at risk and horrible neighborhoods all the time.

Obviously they should face their crimes, I have to go against giving the life sentence to some 15 or 16 year olds. I know I'm off topic, but I wanted to bring that up.
