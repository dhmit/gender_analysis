I decided I wanted to do the meme as well- so I blasted, from my speakers, the song “I’m Han Solo” for the shitty game Star Wars Kinect’s Dance Dance Revolution section. I lined it up so the first “I’m Han Solo!” played at midnight. My girlfriend and her friends were not pleased, but they didn’t have time to react. Needless to say, I did not get a New Years kiss from my girlfriend this year.
