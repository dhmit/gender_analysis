They were definitely just trying to “subvert expectations” by not showing Rey as a Jedi in the ads and focusing on the scenes where Finn uses a lightsaber. Because it’s clearly way more original to have the protagonist yet again be a desert nobody with amazing force powers. A stormtrooper learning the force and going up against the people who killed his parents and enslaved him wouldnt be interesting at all huh
