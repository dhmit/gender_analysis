It's a regular AMOLED defect that can happen randomly. It is also caused when you drop the device or kinda put it through some trauma.

Samsung does supply the AMOLED panels that Apple uses. I remember this green line issue being very very prominent with the release of the iPhone X, where a large amount of people had to get their screens replaced/warranty honored.
