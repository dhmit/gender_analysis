The credits you got from crates at the time were such a pittance that it was faster to just play the game and get credits that way. 

For an average round of the main game mode, you would get like 480 credits for your ~15 minutes of playing. At the time, some heroes cost 40k credits, but most were cheaper than that. If you get that rate of credits at a steady rate, it would take a but over 22 hours to he able to buy the most expensive thing in the game. 

I really don't get what the outrage was about. Progressing and unlocking things is a core part of most video games, and it always has been. It wouldn't be fun if you could get everything right away, either.
