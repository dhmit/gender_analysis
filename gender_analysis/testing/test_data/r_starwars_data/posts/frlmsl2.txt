I actually think that if they had real balls, collectively, that they would have let him go through with his sacrifice to save the entire rebellion.

First, the idea that he's all by himself apart from the other speeders, going full out, and another speeder easily catches him is just absurd. A level of story telling and suspension of disbelief that is right out of TROS.

Second, and more important, there was a major theme that the rebellion was hard fought, in literal and human terms. The bravery of one guy who wanted to make something more of his life should be respected and have great value. Instead it's just a stunt hardly more sophisticated than a jump scare. Main character in danger? Try plot armor in the style of deus ex machina! It works great!

Instead we have Luke's force projection stalling for time then he dies from the exertion? Or something?
