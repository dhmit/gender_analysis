Finns original arc of disillusioned storm trooper turned rebel leader was interesting, but I feel they just forgot about it? Like towards the end something was missing. It’s a little how I feel about Padme from the prequels. Badass queen and fighter turned crying weak women that dies because of sadness? What the actual fuck? Her character should’ve been strong enough to at least survive for the kids. I know she was dead in the original trilogy so I’d rather see her die from protecting baby Luke and leia or something
