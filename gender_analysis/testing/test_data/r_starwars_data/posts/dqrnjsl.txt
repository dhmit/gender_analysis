Man. Many years ago I worked on a DVD for "Choose You Own Adventure" that Mark had voiced a character in. At the time I was no longer authoring DVD's but was managing a team of people who did. However I actually personally authored this one simply because Mark was involved. I sort of managed the entire disc personally just because I could.

As a result I received an invite to the "Premiere" which was an event at some kind of animal rescue in LA. I knew Mark would attend so I of course RSVP'd as well. I also brought my son because well first he was a Star Wars fan but mostly I thought a kid would be a good excuse to approach Mark for an autograph or just initiate any type of interaction with him that I could keep as a memory.

So my son and I arrive a little early, and we come into a room with a 100 or so folding chairs almost all empty. We find a couple seats not too close to the front and not to close to the back.

Not to long after that, and way before the majority of guests arrive Mark Hamill walks in and takes a chair literally like 10 feet away from me. So now I am staring at Mark Hamill, while trying NOT to stare at Mark Hamill (or at least not get caught) while also trying to convince my son in a whisper to approach him and ask for an autograph.

The sad end to this story is that my son was too shy to approach him, and given that Mark was alone I did not want to interrupt him either so I ended up never even saying hi or shaking his hand, let alone getting an autograph.

I had no idea at the time how cool of a dude he was (the internet wasn't as much of a thing then, and Reddit probably didn't exist) so at the time, and in the moment, I felt it was best to just let him be.

Oh well. sigh.

edit: Holy, shit. here is a picture of Mark at that event! https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/culver-city-july-22-mark-hamill-128972639?src=qXnk23G39xfR7obm97LfbQ-1-22
