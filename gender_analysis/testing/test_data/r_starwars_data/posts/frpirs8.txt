Honestly I thought with the the title of  episode 7 that we were going to get a story where Rey, Finn, and Poe were all going to experience a force awakening and that Luke was going to train all three to lead a new generation of Jedi after Kylo destroys his 1st attempt. I thought there was a plan for all three movies but it turns out they were writing it as it went.
