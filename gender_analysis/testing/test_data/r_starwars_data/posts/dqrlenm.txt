I mean he told her he was having dreams of her dying in childbirth. And he says "you die in childbirth" as if he knows it's a fact, not just stating what happens in the dream, which I figured was enough to clue Padme in that he was serious.

He's also by this point had his little "I'm not powerful enough" power-hungry rant in front of Padme. Combined with the ominous "I'll find a way to save you Padme" declaration, I don't know how many more signs he could've given her.

Ninja edit: Obviously it would be great if he sat down and explained everything, and it's perhaps unfair to pin it on padme for not recognizing his, shall we say, symptoms. But since his character is kinda predestined to turn to the dark side, we can't expect him to behave super rationally, it's just not in his character. But it is in Padme's, which is why I'm focusing on her inactions.
