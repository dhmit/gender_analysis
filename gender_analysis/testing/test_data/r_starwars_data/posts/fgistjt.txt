I can see why they cut it. The framing and action feels too much like a skit, there's no real movement to it. To include this in the sequence it's meant to be a part of would be to stop the action _dead_ for what would feel like an eternity. This is when everyone's evacuating, you need more movement so the viewer feels caught up in a commotion, rising toward a climax. It's funny, but it doesn't fit.
