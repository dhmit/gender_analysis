What's most impressive about Hamill's turn at the Joker is how well he is able to ebb and flow out of the character.     [My personal favorite is the performance of the Joker Speech from Killing Joke he gave at Star Wars Celebration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Jz4xCONAE)      Everything down to the physicality and emotional nuance of it, it's the roller coaster that The Joker should be!       








Also that laugh!
