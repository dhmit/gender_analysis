You know how a new sequel to a movie comes out and it sucks, so people are like “it’s alright, it doesn’t change make the first one any worse?”

Heard a lot of that about the prequels, and they were right. Even with all the dumb shit from the prequels the OT stands alone and is great, and it even makes sense in context with the prequels!

7 wasn’t a bad movie, but somehow 8 and 9 managed to make it worse. And still, 9 somehow made 8 better for me. The prequels were a total shit show, but at least it felt like it had at least some direction be hind it. They also introduced a ton of really, really cool shit that the games and EU materials explored wonderfully, and there were good things to grasp. The sequel trilogy is like watching a headless chicken try to write movies. 9 might have been one of the least enjoyable movies I’ve watched in a long time. At least in 8 it was up and down. 9 misses the mark on every single thing that could be great with so much consistency that it’s remarkable.

The sequels *really* need an EU treatment and a some good media to come out of them, like the prequels.
