I was in LA once and happened upon a comic book shop that had Matt Groening and Mark Hamill signing treehouse of horror comics. It was supposed to end at a decent hour but the shop had miscalculated when they stopped letting people in line and it was going well into the evening. Around 7 Mark Hamill has to leave but instead of just taking off he got up and walked down the line to make sure he not only signed something for everyone but also took a few seconds to talk to them. He was a super nice guy.
