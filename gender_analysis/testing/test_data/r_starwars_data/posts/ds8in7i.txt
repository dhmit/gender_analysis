I hate this argument. When we said we wanted something different, it should've gone without saying we wanted it to be good too. TFA was at the very least, competently made. TLJ is 'different' and 'ooh pretty camera shot' but the plot, dialogue, characters...they're all dogshit and often redundant. Not to mention the awful overuse of humour, the inability to set a tone, godawful pacing and preposterous runtime. High School Musical is a very 'different' movie to Star Wars, but I won't be called a hypocrite for not wanting Zac Efron to start singing on Tatooine midway through the 2nd act. There is a world of possibility between 'New Hope ripoff' and 'Kinda different, but shitty'. Anybody who doesn't see that is being purposefully dense. 

TL;DR: People's reasons for disliking TLJ are more nuanced than fans give them credit for.
