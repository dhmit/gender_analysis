There’s nothing else to say about these movies. They just fucking suck. Can’t have two characters in conversation for more than a minute because the people in the audience will pull out their phones. 

Like the scene where Old Ben is explaining to Luke about how his father was the greatest star pilot in the galaxy. People would just say that the movie is “really slow” if they did that in today’s movies. They’re so used to the MCU style of everything has to move quickly! No time to absorb the scene or dialogue! Here’s some quippy humor, now laugh! 

This stupid trilogy has nothing meaningful and it’s a god damn shame that it keeps being propped up as this amazing piece of work.
