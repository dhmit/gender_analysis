I was watching previous star wars' and one of the things I noticed that I couldn't articulate before was the source of the comedy. Most of the comedy in other Star Wars' (including TFA to an extent) came from witty lines from characters (exception being Binks), while most of the comedy from TLJ came from wacky querky animal antics. They felt more like cutaway gags rather than a humour that came from the movie itself. 

It very much reminded me of Jar Jar.
