Mannnnn that's what I'm saying. I thought he was gonma get tempted to the dark side or something, and end up having an epic fight with Rey. 7 looked like there were so many cool plots that could happen. And they just never did. Instead, he got relegated to Side Character A, with the romance mini plot involving Unimportant Character C, and just never did anything. Tbh, I kinda feel bad for most of the actors cuz they were kinda robbed.
