I want a kid to do this and ask for The Joker from Batman: TAS. 

But then I want the kid to miraculously pull through. 

Related: Chris Evans and Chris Pratt do this too, but Evans... [Takes it more seriously.](http://people.com/celebrity/chris-evans-and-chris-pratt-visit-seattle-childrens-hospital/) (I've seen Pratt do it as Star Lord as well, but I can't seem to find that article ATM. Pratt does it A LOT.) 

I believe Johnny Depp has done it as Jack Sparrow before too. John Boyega has done it as Finn, Tom Holland has done it as Spider-Man, Jaimie Alexander has done it as Lady Sif. Gal Gadot has done it, but I don't think she visited in costume. 

Some celebrities are awesome.
