You had to buy them if you wanted to play them online, it was a pain. Every hero is unlocked for all now which makes it much better for new players.

You could never *directly* buy them with real world money, you could buy a ton of loot boxes and get credits that way. Just one of the many reasons the game was hated at launch.
