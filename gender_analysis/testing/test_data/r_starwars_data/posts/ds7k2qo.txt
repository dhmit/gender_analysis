Agreed. Logically, in the discovery/creation of light speed travel would have been decades of controlled light speed particles, nano objects, small things with measuring instruments in them to test the technology until finally something large enough to fit humans was created. Now surely every single person who was involved in this would have the thought “fuck me this could be used to fuck some shit up, let’s hope this doesn’t fall into the wrong hands” shortly followed by “well it may fall into the hands of a bad guy, we better produce some weapons using this tech to make sure we are safe”. I know I’m being very fucking specific but using history and human nature, if light speed objects  could be used as weapons, they would be around at the same time travelling at light speed was made possible - if not earlier. 

These kind of issues a riddled through TLJ which I couldn’t get past and I didn’t enjoy the film at all. I’m not going to rant on but any movie that ignores 7 previous movies and brings out issues and themes that don’t make sense or aren’t logical and expect me to go with it “because they said so”, is just not good enough.
