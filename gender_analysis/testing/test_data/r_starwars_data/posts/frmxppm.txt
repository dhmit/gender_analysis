The problem was that Poe Dameron was supposed to die in the Tie Fighter crash on Jakku in TFA and Poe’s character arc would have become Finn’s. Think about it... former stormtrooper becomes Resistance leader. Unfortunately they cast Oscar Isaac who the production wanted to keep around because he’s a brilliant actor but it diluted Finn’s role because of it. I think Oscar actually asked them to rewrite the script so he’d come back after his “death”. There was an opportunity to then explore Finn’s force sensitivity as hinted at in TFA but as The Last Jedi script was being written before TFA was completed it was probably easy for Rian to miss those visual clues that may not have been scripted. (For the record, not a dig at TLJ as I loved it). It was just a shame Finn didn’t get to explore any Jedi training in TROS which would be brought back some purpose.
