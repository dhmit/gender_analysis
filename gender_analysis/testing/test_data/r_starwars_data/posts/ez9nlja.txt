Treating glitches and balance issues that cheat players out of fun as a *normality* is nowhere near the best way to support the game.

Even beyond lightsabers and heroes in general, there are bugs and problems that only serve to hinder the player experience rather than support it.

The best way to go about the game is be open and honest about the solutions in a constructive and unbiased way.
