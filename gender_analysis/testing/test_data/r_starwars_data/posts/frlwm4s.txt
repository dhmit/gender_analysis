One of the deleted scenes from The Last Jedi is Finn bumping into some old buddies from his academy days.  It humanizes the FO stormtroopers and shows that Finn was also memorable enough.  I think the guy, voiced by Tom Hardy, says something like "always knew you'd make it as an officer".

His whole arc should have been showing that stormtroopers are not just faceless enemy and that he could inspire them to  rise up against their oppressors.
