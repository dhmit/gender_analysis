Yeah games have always been a grind. A grind you pay sixty bucks to endure. What's greedy and shady as fuck is releasing a game, charging 60 bucks for it, and knowing full God damned well that the game isn't full in any way shape or form. It's not a 'grind' if the game ships with literally ten percent of the content advertised in development. It's not just a grind, you can't just shrug your shoulders and say *BuT yOu dOnT HaVe t0 pAY!!!* nah you're right all you have to do is slog through 125 hours of garbage with the virtually unplayable entry level garbage. It's a scam. They got exactly as much hate as they deserve, fuck EA.
