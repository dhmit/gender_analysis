I feel like he should have either been a jedi from the start (instead of Rey) or just how he was in TFA and TLJ. The one thing that I really disliked about TROS was how they teased Finn's Force sensitivity. Like what are the odds of two complete strangers meeting each other and they can both use the Force?
