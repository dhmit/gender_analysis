A young, up-and-coming, but still essentially unknown actor getting a lead role in a fucking Star Wars film, getting heaps of deserved praise for all three films and becoming a household name in the process, is not someone who was done dirty.

And I say that as someone who did not like IX and who thinks ditching the natural, foreshadowed, and thematically resonant stormtrooper rebellion plot (so as to save more time for the return of Palpatine) was a colossal missed opportunity that TROS didn't recover from. 

Overdramatic shit like this is fucking inane. It's a good example of the masturbatory hate industry that's grown up around Star Wars, which so often tries to justify itself with moral language.
