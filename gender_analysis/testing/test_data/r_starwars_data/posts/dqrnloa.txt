>If anakin could simply have a wife and family, he wouldnâ€™t have ever become Vader.

I know the EU Books are not canon, but in the books Luke later completely dismisses the whole "no wife and kids attachment" thing cause of how the power of love saved Anakin and Luke.  

I see why the Jedi say no to be emotional -- They are supposed to be objective and clear headed in any situation.  And even in one of the cringey moments in Part 2, Anakin states that Jedi are supposed to be compassionate.
