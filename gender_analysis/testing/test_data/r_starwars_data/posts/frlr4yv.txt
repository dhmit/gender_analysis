Nah.  He was fighting for the hatred he had for the First Order at that point.

And TLJ was primarily about two things: what is good and what is evil is usually more complex than the what the world tells you, and that failure can be an important step to true success and victory.

TLJ was clearly moving toward a more nuanced neutral force wielder that is neither what we know as jedi or what we know as sith.  The trilogy could've built beautifully on some of the insightful but clumsilly carried lessons from the prequels (that the jedi pushed Anakin toward the darkside with their unrealistic rules, and jedi are evil from some perspectives).  Instead, RoS just broke everything TLJ did well (failure is a great teacher, Rey is special because of who she chose to be not because of her parents, jedi arent perfect and dont own the light side of the force) but instead it just showed the only thing that matters is lineage and Rey has super powers because she super praysd and gained the power of every jedi ever.
