>neither a Jedi nor a Sith, but rather as a Grey Force

But balance isn't light and dark for Star Wars, is just light.

Ending with a mix of both would have been to contradict the very basic of the nature of the Force which is different and worse than adding new Force powers.

There's no light side, the Force is good by itself and the dark side is a poison, a corruption.
