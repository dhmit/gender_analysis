Phasma should have been Finn's archnemesis the whole trilogy. Plus, it would have given them an excuse to give her more screentime and actually do something. Imagine having part of TLJ and RoS being her chasing him for being a traitor.

Instead, she had one scene in TLJ after barely being used in TFA, and she dies at the end by falling down a pit or something. Come on!
