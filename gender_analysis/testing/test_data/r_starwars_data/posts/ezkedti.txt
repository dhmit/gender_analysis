I'm a little bummed they locked the thread. I don't think Devs deserve death threats but this was a great way for us to call them on their greed.

EA has been doing this kind of thing for a while now, it would be nice if this didn't continue. Release a good working game and we will happily play it. 

Or if anyone else wants to chime in, whats your favorite game from the pre-loot box era?
