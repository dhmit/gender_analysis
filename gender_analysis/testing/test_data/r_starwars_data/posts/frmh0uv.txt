The sequel trilogy was a failure. Each individual movie is good in its own right, but it doesnâ€™t work as a trilogy, so many potential great plot lines were ignored or thrown away, so many great characters wasted by poor character development and weak script writing. If they move to de-canonize the sequels, that would 100% be fine by me.
