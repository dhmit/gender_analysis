This is all stuff that ROS failed to do anything with.  Learning that stuff was their beat for Last Jedi.  ROS failed to build on almost everything established before it.  The third movie should've had all the main characters challenging the way things have always been, based on what they learned in Last Jedi, in order to build a better way for future generations.   RoS failed to do that and instead tried to rewrite the entire trilogy.
