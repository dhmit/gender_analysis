it's not. The titans were part of the map. In this mode, you're just changing maps when you capture the most points and then board the ship. It doesn't have that "blast from an APC via pod on ground level to a flying titan, infiltrate with your squad and destroy titan's reactor's with C4s and jump out at the last second of an exploding giant ship" feeling.

Also that insane lag when the two titans starting inching so close together, lmao. I miss titan mode.
