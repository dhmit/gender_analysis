Thank you. I get shit for that a lot on certain subs. Especially /r/publicfreakout usually. 

I just don't think prison is solely a punishment system. It should be a deterrent, a safety measure for non-criminals, and a rehabilitation for those that still have a shot at life. That's where the taxpayers actually benefit.
