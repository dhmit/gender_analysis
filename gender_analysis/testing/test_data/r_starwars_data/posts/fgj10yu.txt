A bitchy robot being carried around in pieces on the back of a giant ewok didn’t bother you?

I’m just poking at you.  I thought this was hilarious and could see Han yelling at 3PO to ‘hey rip that sign off and get in the ship’ and later R2 beeps again 3PO and he says ‘well I don’t know what it said, I was in a rush’ and looks down...

‘Oh dear...’
