> The sequels really need an EU treatment and a some good media to come out of them, like the prequels.

I don't know how the EU could fix the sequels, other than just retconning them.

It worked with the prequels because the prequels are a good story at their core with the main problems being characters and dialogue.  So when TCW comes out and makes Anakin a more likable and heroic character, that makes it better.

The ST just sends the horrible message that nothing that happens in the first six movies matter.  The Empire comes back and takes over the galaxy again, the Jedi are destroyed again, the OT heroes all end up failures who die (relatively) young, Palpatine wasn't actually defeated and gets revenge everyone by destroying their lives.  No amount of extra detail is going to make that not awful.
