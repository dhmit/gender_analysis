Could of had him and the stormtrooper run aways steal armours and infiltrate a First Order base (or "Final Order") 

Cut to later in the movie, massive AT-ATs and armoured vehicles circle a rebel base (similar to TLJ) on the ground and Star Destroyers approach the main heroes in the sky. You get a "Fire When Ready" moment and the cannons load up. But what's this? They turn their turrets towards the rest of the fleet! The ex-troopers have taken control of part of their fleet and there's a big ground and space war.

That could replace the daft space horse scene.
