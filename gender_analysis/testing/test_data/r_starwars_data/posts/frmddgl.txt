The fact that Yoda's powers are even more physics-breaking shouldn't really imply that it's an ultra difficult feat to move a bit in the vacuum of space. The zero gravity drift is easily one of the least impressive bits of magic in any of the movies. You could literally do it yourself with a few pounds of compressed gas (even the survival without a spacesuit part is mostly doable without magic for a short time).

For the theory that self-propulsion isn't possible, we see a ton of self-propulsion in the form of force jumps. Luke's Cloud City force jump is way faster and has mass working against gravity's acceleration (i.e. actual force).

Leia didn't have any training when she was able to communicate telepathically with Luke in the original trilogy, it really shouldn't be an issue that decades later she'd have enough force sensitivity and training to very slowly drift in space.
