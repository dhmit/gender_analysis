You completely ignored what I said LOL.  

I realize we're talking about ANH, I mentioned Billy Dee Williams to highlight that fact that even in the rest of the original trilogy there are literally no other americans.   

Again, almost everyone but the 4 actors (you left out Jones) was British.  It was filmed mostly in England with Almost entirely british cast.  Even the damn Ewoks were british.

Did you look into why Lucas chose to film in England?
