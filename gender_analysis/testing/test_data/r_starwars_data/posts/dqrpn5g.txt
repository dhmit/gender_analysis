i'd have to disagree, the jedi creed says:

There is no emotion, there is peace.
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
There is no passion, there is serenity.
There is no chaos, there is harmony.
There is no death, there is the Force

although one of mace windu's disciples and younger jedi apparently started reciting this creed, which i agree with more, but is very different than the first idealogically. 

Emotion, yet peace.
Ignorance, yet knowledge.
Passion, yet serenity.
Chaos, yet harmony.
Death, yet the Force
