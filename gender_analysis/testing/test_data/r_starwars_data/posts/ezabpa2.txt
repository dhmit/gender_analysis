I played a bit after they stopped selling loot boxes but you still got them by leveling.   Came back recently and was amazed when gaining a level meant I could just pick a card to unlock or upgrade. It felt so much better.

Seems like you were around at the time, why did they design such an obtuse system?  How did it make them extra money?  I imagine some of the misinformation was because the boxes added needless complexity.
