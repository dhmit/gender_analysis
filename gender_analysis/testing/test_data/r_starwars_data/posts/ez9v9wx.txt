No it didn't. The game got worse, and continues to get worse with each update. 

As a result of the "outrage" and lower sales, EA basically cut off future support for the game. Now there is a tiny skeleton crew working on the title and it's the D-team. They ruin more things than they fix, their gameplay changes are all awful and actively make the game worse.
