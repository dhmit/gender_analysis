Hey there!

If you haven't, go to your phone app and type

*# 0 * #

Then, click Red, Green, Blue.

Do this once. Then repeat several times if need be. Sometimes this can fix the issue. I've not seen it work well with Purple lines, but green may be the better to try because it is being manually reset when you hit green. 

Good luck!
