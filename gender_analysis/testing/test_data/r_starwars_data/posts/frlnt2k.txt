A theory I heard before that I jive with is that after decades of being suppressed and denied, the Force swung hard in the opposite direction and suddenly manifested in a bunch of people all at the same time (and in Rey’s case, so strongly). That’s why the first new sequel was called the Force *Awakens*.
