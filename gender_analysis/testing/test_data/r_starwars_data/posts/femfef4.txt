Oooh that is so true. Even within the context of this picture. 

The face that you’re so familiar with picks up this brand new thing and is such a pro with it.  

He comforts it and moves it around in such a way that you wonder “was he THIS good when *I* was a baby?!

And then you see how natural he is with it, and you let it go, recognizing how happy you both are in your new roles.
