I've worked on social media accounts before and the two most frustrating things were:  
   
- Being asked to say things you didn't agree with on a personal level.  
   
- Knowing some kind of "insider information" that legitimately explains an issue that customers are angry about, but not being able to say anything about it because it's confidential or personal to someone else.  
    
In my career, the first case has only happened about 2 or 3 times so even though it's hugely frustrating, at least it's fairly rare.  
   
The second case would happen so often though that I would occasionally go rogue and just start speaking as myself and being as open and honest as I possibly could. Sometimes I'd have to say something empty like "I know it's shit, but there is a reason for it, it's just not something we can share yet. I wish I could though!" But that felt better than just a copy and paste line of business speak.  
    
I ended up creating a really good relationship with our customers though, even when I left the role I stayed in touch with many of them because we'd become friends. I think more companies should trust their staff to just post as people, not as corporate entities.
