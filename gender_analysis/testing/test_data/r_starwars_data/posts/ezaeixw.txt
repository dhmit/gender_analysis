The "Great Canvas shortage of 2018" is my all time favorite fuck up. So much hilarity ensued from that. So many funny comments and memes. Like, "I completely understand. I lost my father in the canvas Mines when I was a young boy". I can't replicate how funny it was but stuff like that had me cracking up.
