I've thought about this a lot and I think there's a deeper meaning to the whole, "a Jedi shall not know emotions, etc." I think what it means isn't necessarily that a Jedi shouldn't feel emotions but that you shouldn't let emotions and personal feelings cloud your judgment from what is right and wrong.
