I strongly disagree with that last part about Anakin. It was **exactly** because he had a wife that he turned to the dark side. He lost control of his his love for Padme (and his grief over his mother) and became so obsessed that he began to believe he could cheat death.

If Anakin had heeded Yoda's warning: "train yourself to let go of that which you fear to lose", he would have been able to pull himself back from the brink. Instead he sacrificed everything that he valued (his allegiance to the Jedi, his relationship with Obi-wan and his even his wife) in the vain pursuit of absolute power.
