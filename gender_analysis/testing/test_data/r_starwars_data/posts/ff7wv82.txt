Well like another commenter already said this lore has been phased out and was never really solid to begin with since its purpose was more as a game mechanic than anything else. However, yes, you're correct about them. Consulars got more force points and force powers, guardians got more feats and HP, and sentinels were somewhere in between, meant to focus on skill points.
