I always thought it really off putting that he goes from being a trooper, raised from a young age training with his brothers in arms, to killing them like they were nothing to him in 5 seconds. His arch would have been much better if instead of a coward running he was a pacifist. Refusing to follow his orders to harm innocents and then refusing to harm his brothers he was raised with. Have his character pushed to the point of having to choose between Rey and his past. That would have been better imo.
