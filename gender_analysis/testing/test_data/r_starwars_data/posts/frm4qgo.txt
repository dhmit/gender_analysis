I remember a fan theory years ago when the force awakens came out that was something like the "awakening" was through Finn and that while Rey's force abilities were gifted, they were from a natural affinity with the dark side, rather than light, which is why snoke was more concerned with Finn's awakening than Rey's. They were predicting that while Rey starts out good, she ends up turned to the dark side. The revelation being she was a palpatine but only finds that out after she gets disarmed by Finn and Kylo in a light saber fight or something then jumps to her death upon hearing the news and can't deal with it. Kylo would also have his own redemption arc, turning to the light as Rey turns to the dark. 

When I read that, not really being a big follower of Star Wars, I thought, "that sounds pretty cool." Then I found out about how the story actually went in the last movie after being thoroughly disappointed with 7 and 8 and thought they really screwed the pooch.
