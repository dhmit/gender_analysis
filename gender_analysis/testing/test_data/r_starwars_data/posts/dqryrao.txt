Ford has always struck me as not so much a dick, but rather playing the curmudgeon to keep people at a bit of a distance. He's a very private dude for the most part - I don't think he necessarily cares for the celebrity aspect of his work. You can kind of see it whenever anyone asks him about past roles or what his favorite role was. However, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit in the past few years. 

I think he was disappointed that the first trilogy didn't end the way he wanted it to for his character, but when you watched him doing the promoting and press junkets for TFA, he seemed genuinely exciting and happy about the movie.
