I really hope John Boyega gets another shot at a franchise picture deal.

Yeah, yeah, I know. There are other actors, and franchise tent pole movies are stifling creativity and is a blight in Hollywood, but still: I love John Boyega! He's got great on screen charisma, and has the talent to back it up.

It just sucks that his other most recent venture didn't pan out, Pacific Rim: Uprising. I argue he just needs his second big break (Star Wars IS the biggest break an actor can get, but....well, given how Star Wars is now, not so much.)

I want to see him in a Marvel film. Him and Oscar Isaac. They were solid actors, whose characters had great potential, but arguably blind sided by the script.
