I'm willing to agree with you if you can provide me with in-universe proof that a ship could go through a shield without a fractional refresh rate at lightspeed.

Also, don't forget that this situation would have been easily avoided if the Supremacy had just shot the Raddus before it went into hyperspace.  It isn't like this kind of strategy is indefensible.
