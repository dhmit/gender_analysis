How does that even work? If they were kidnapped as children, why would they have a choice as to what their job would be? It makes more sense for him to of washed out of Stormtrooper training to end up as a janitor than for him to go from janitor to Stormtrooper.

Outside of not making him a Jedi like the post suggests, his character was just wasted potential. Stormtroopers aren't exactly elite soldiers and it's known that they have bad aim (in the Mandalorian) but they could at least of made him more competent as a soldier. Instead we get a guy who acts like it's his first day on the job by being surprised by everything and getting overexcited because he took out ONE torpedo.
