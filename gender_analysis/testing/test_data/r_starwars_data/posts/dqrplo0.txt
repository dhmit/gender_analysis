You don't need to be famous to do these things. Put a $20 a paycheck donation into your local Make-A-Wish. While Make-A-Wish is a national charity, every state has their own chapter that work locally. They are independent from Make-A-Wish America. They target kids with life-threatening medical conditions in YOUR area specifically. All your money goes directly to local kids. 

Contact them. My local Make-A-Wish does fund-raising events like hiking or running events, or dinners. You can participate in wishes, particularly ones where crowds make events better such as "Wish to have..." events or "Wish to be.." events. 

Don't think that you need to personally finance a wish or ten to make a difference. Your $10-$20 would likely go unmissed by you, but adds up to making a huge difference to giving strength, hope, and joy to a family with a Wish child.
