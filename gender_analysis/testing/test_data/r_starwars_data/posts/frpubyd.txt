Again, place blame where you like it, the middle film still sucked less. 

Luke's father was taken in by a celibate priesthood of space wizards who gave him a tremendous complex about the lady he liked. This was exploited to the point of neurosis by his only other support structure, a cartoonishly evil autocrat and secret reverse wizard. The Jedi fucked up so hard with Anakin that it killed nearly all of them. 

Luke grew up farming *water* with the guy who thought he killed Luke's dad kinda hanging out nearby. Not raising him or training him, just being a weird hermit he knows. Not far enough away to avoid getting Luke's foster parents murdered. Yeah it turns out Luke's dad being the evil empire's second-in-command has some consequences, but Old Ben doesn't mention it until after he sends Luke to personally kill his own father. Which costs him a limb. 

Ben also doesn't discourage him from flirting with the princess they rescued. 

Luke becoming an irrelevant hermit himself is in 7, so you can't blame 8 for it. 8 gives a fine explanation: he tried training more Jedi, one of them was an evil little shit, everybody else died. Luke followed his mentors' footsteps by giving up and hiding in the middle of nowhere. 

So yeah, the Jedi were not a net positive influence on the Skywalker family. Luke's sister at least got to be royalty, somehow, until his dad's work buddies blew up her entire planet.

I like how 7's flaws have nothing to do with 8's performance, but 8's flaws have everything to do with Solo's performance. That's a neat trick. 

> They don’t want fans divided.

Oops. 

> TLJ has massive plot holes, tries to re-write history, has Deus Ex Machina’s everywhere, subplots that’s go nowhere, etc. it’s got all kinds of problems to it.

Respectively: no, not really, very no, not really, and yeah absolutely. The lightspeed missile gimmick is slightly bullshit but also one of the coolest parts of the terrible A plot. That plot doesn't have holes, it's just dumb: forced conflict through pointless secrecy, in a low-speed chase. It's internally consistent, it's just contrived, because the point is the B plot, with the movie's protagonist: Rose. 

The movie opens with a heroic sacrifice that's immediately called into question. That dead soldier's sister catches Finn deserting, and stops him, 'or she died for nothing.' She volunteers for the risky hail-mary mission to the planet of war profiteers, where she becomes disillusioned and symbolically frees some animals. Her arc completes when she prevents Finn from repeating her sister's sacrifice. Her values have shifted away from duty. Again, excellent anti-war plot, poor fit for "Star Wars."

I cannot overstate how perfect the final shot of 8 is: a nameless child casually using the Force as he looks to the stars. Rose and Rey's plots both lead straight into that. Shame about what happens right before it.

The C plot is Rey in search of motivation. She picks up at the asinine point 7 ended on, with her handing Luke an object he obviously does not want. Remember: he made it himself and can presumably sense its location. If he wanted a lightsaber he'd have it. He grudgingly trains her and reminds her the Force is in all things. This was straight from ANH. Baby's first subtext: anyone can be a hero. You don't have to be born special. This is underlined in bold when Kylo tells her she's wasting time obsessing over her mysteeeerious past. Her parents don't matter - she is free to choose her own destiny. And that's where her plot should have ended.

Instead we got a surprise fourth act that makes me doubt all claims that Disney left Rian unattended. This movie is jam-packed with thematic imagery that supports the B and C plots - then it ends with a pointless aristocratic duel. Amid an eye-rolling callback to a lost battle. With Luke going 'whoops nevermind' about the last decade of his life. And Rose running back to the army whose materiel she just ditched. 

8 is flawed primarily because the edit does not understand what the text is about. Surely Disney leaned on Rian to steer closer to the status quo, then threw him under the bus when that resulted in conflicting tones. 

But when you talk about a slapped-together plot full of dead ends, I think you're picturing 9.
