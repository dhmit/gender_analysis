I dunno if it's canon anymore but it was possible to make kyber crystals through some sort of force guided process similar to creating an artificial diamond.  It takes a long time, and for some reason I can't remember they're considered inferior to natural kyber crystals.

I think it might have been mentioned in Shadow of the Empire?
