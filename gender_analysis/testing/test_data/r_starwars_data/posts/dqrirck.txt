The original tweeter mentions being in the film industry, it's not unreasonable to assume they live in Southern California. It's also not unreasonable to assume tweeter's friend (and sick child) lives in Southern California because people tend to know people that live near them. And Mark Hamill is *from* California dn in the entertainment business, so again it's pretty safe to assume he lives in Southern California.

So not to take away from Mark Hamill doing this totally awesome thing, but I think it's reasonable to expect it was a not-unbearable drive for Mark to get to this kid. Other than the fact that he would have been driving in Southern California, of course.
