There were a lot more problems in the sequels than that lol, but I agree, I'm including the prequels as part of the 2/3 that is "bad"... 

I'm just pointing out that, as the shows have proven, there's still a decent overall plot in the prequels (even if everything else about them makes them awful), whereas it'd be harder to create a show that improves on the sequels, since the overall plot points are bad and even contradictory to themselves.
