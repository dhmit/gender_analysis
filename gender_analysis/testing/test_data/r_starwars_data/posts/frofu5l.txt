I still think he should have died in episode 8, just imagine the impact it would have had on everyone if he finished that solo charge straight at Kylo on Crait instead of Luke dying. Rey might actually be wrestling with becoming a sith more. And as much as I loved Finn it would have just been a badass way for him to go.
