I didn't like Finn as a character in Force Awakens and I'm glad be became less important. 

He's a flip-flopper. Traumatised veteran to whooping as he blows up former friends to running coward to gutsy rebel back to running coward then to brave idealist. I just don't find any of his transitions compelling and most of the blame lies with Force Awakens rather than the other two that people seem to hate more.
