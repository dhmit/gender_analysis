I still maintain that Padme should’ve led a vote of no confidence against Palpatine in Ep 3. Realizing Palpatine was everything he swore to destroy when ousting Valorum, Padme would campaign to remove Palpatine on a platform of negotiating a treaty with the Separatists and giving back emergency powers to the Senate. It doesn’t have to be a main arc but just a side story to show even without a lightsaber and blaster, an intelligent woman dedicated to democracy could’ve almost bested Palpatine. You could even tie in the cut early stages of the rebellion scenes after the vote inevitably fails by a close margin
