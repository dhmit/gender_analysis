TFA set up lots of plot lines that Rian completely discarded in TLJ. TRoS at least tried to scramble something together that could close out the trilogy with what was left. There wasn’t a single subplot from TFA that Rian used and he didn’t leave anything left for JJ other than a more diminished resistance and a partially trained Rey. Instead Rian focused on political statements and “anyone can be a force user” instead of just making a fucking Star Wars movie.
