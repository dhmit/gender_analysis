Pretty sure we DID vote with our wallet as the game became almost impossible to give away. Sony was stuck with an overabundance of Battlefront 2 themed PS4s that they just couldn't get rid of. Also anytime you head to the Battlefront 2 subreddit, their comments section is full of "gee I wish people would actually come and try the game. I don't get why they're still so angry". They lost so much money that Papa Disney got angry at them for damaging their brand.
