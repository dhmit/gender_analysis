I want to like the new trilogy. I want to like it so bad that I’m aware that  I’m losing a battle of self inflicted delusion. I hate it, Disney had no plan and it’s so blatant. They were just getting drunk off the fast cash. The bean counters rushed it and the fans got a fuckin mess that I’ve been trying to convince myself to like because I’ve been a StarWars fan (!!!) my whole life and I don’t want to be the wet blanket.
