This is going to be buried in all these comments but I’m kind of upset Disney just gave up on the sequel trilogy, they could’ve had a show building off of episode 9 where they’d hunt down the remains of the first order, expand the survivors of the resistance, and also have Rey teach Finn how to use the saber.
