>If you look carefully, the Raddus didn't cut down 6 other star destroyers by itself. The debris from the Supremacy flies out and hits the remaining star destroyers at near light speeds.

That doesn't say anything other than that it's an incredibly deadly tactic.

>So again, it was a highly situational use

No  it's not.  If a single medium -sized vessel could neutralize an entire fleet, then there's no reason  to  just get a bunch of freighters and ram them into other targets and use remote piloting to ensure no allied deaths.

>Also "the only reason the Supremacy survived is because it was so big". My post specifically addressed the Death Star. You know... the space station that people thought was a moon?

Then just get more ships.  They don't have to even be military ships, just ones which are decently large.
