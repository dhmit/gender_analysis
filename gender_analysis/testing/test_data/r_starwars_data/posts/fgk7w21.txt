I believe the main plan was for Leia to unfreeze Han then escape with Lando’s help, but that backfired when they got caught. Plan B was for Luke to arrive and get captured then break everyone out. R2 had his lightsaber because the security scanners at the entrance wouldn’t have let him in with a weapon, or so the novelization says. Like didn’t know about the Rancor and was probably hoping R2 was nearby when he first talked to Jabba so he could fight if needed, but he wasn’t so he got caught. The plans are all admitted a bit half baked but essentially they all made it out with Plan C and a bit of luck.
