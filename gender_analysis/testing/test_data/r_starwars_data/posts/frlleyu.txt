Because nothing says "redeemed hero" quite like living the rest of your life on a backwater planet running from facing the consequences of helping murder and oppress millions of people, right?

I'm sick of seeing people die immediately after redemption myself, but they wrote themselves into a corner with Kylo Ren.  There's no logical way for him to really come back from what he did without standing trial by whatever new government rises in place of the New Republic.
