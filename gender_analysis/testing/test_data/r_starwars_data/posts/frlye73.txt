At the very least, I wanted him to play a role in the episode 7 final fight.

Say Kylo cuts him down but *intentionally* leaves him alive, maybe to hurt him more or something equally sithy. Then he gets distracted by Rey and leaves him injured but still alive.

Then Rey starts getting beaten, and doesn't have enough time to channel the force while she's being attacked(because sure, he's just gonna wait for her to activate her superpowers...).

Only for Finn to crawl to his blaster and start squeezing off shots at Kylo!

Then he fights both Rey AND Finn at the same time, and finally gets beaten when his wound starts getting the better of him.

It gives Finn a role in the scene AND it makes Kylo seem like a threat.
