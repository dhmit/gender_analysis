Why are the directors allowed so much fucking power over the story where they are making shit up as they go?  There should have been a team of writers and hard plot lines that are non negotiable   without the entire writing staff on board of any changes.  They knew they were making a trilogy before they started. The entire trilogy should have had a outline.
