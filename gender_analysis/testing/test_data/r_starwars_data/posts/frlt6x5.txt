The Force is The Universe as I see it, always trying to find equilibrium. It designates avatars to facilitate this (Anakin being pure Force, Rey, the whole emperor  thing ugh). 

So yeah whomever the Force chooses it seems. When it “awoke” it chose a bunch of people to give itself the best odds?

None of it makes sense, really.
