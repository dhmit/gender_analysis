If you look carefully, the Raddus didn't cut down 6 other star destroyers by itself. The debris from the Supremacy flies out and hits the remaining star destroyers at near light speeds. 

So again, it was a highly situational use. If the Rebels were up against a typical First Order or Imperial fleet, they'd most likely see a formation of star destroyers and like one flagship (like the Executor or a Dreadnought). The debris from most flagships wouldn't be *near* enough to just cascade and destroy a whole fleet like the Sipremacy's was. The Supremacy is a *massive* ship, even by Star Wars standards (I believe the guidebooks state that it has a crew/boarding capacity  of 3 *million* people). The cascading debris that destroyed the whole fleet was again something specific to this situation, it was most likely not repeatable. 

Also "the only reason the Supremacy survived is because it was so big". My post specifically addressed the Death Star. You know... the space station that people thought was a moon?
