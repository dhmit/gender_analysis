When I was in high school and I did a creative writing class, I had to write short stories, and a lot of times I’d introduce a character or plot point that I intended to use, but I’d just keep writing and all of the sudden I was at the end, and I realized I didn’t do anything with the person or plot point. 

It makes me wonder if that’s what happened. That they were just trying to make up a story for him as it went along, but then it just never materialized, so they said “fuck it” and basically made him irrelevant.
