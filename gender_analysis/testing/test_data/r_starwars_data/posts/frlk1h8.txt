Rey was just a desperate attempt bring The Portrayal of a strong female character into the Mainstream. We didn't see much character development and she was very average and lacked little to none defining features that made her stand out to any of the other characters. Finn was so much more than that. He was a tortured soul who had spent years under the wing of the empire who rebelled and decided to become his own person rather than conform to others orders. That was interesting and alot of people liked that. Last Jedi ruined the character and completely forgot about Finn during the writing and just used the character to push the story and in Rise of the Skywalker we barely got to see the poor guy. It's a huge shame. The second Finn picked up the lightsaber he just oozed Jedi and everything about the character felt right. It's so disappointing the way the trilogy turned out. People love to bash the prequels but at least we could see the characters develop. We could see the transformation of Anakin and how he become merely a Podracing Slave to The most feared Sith lord in the galaxy and that was interesting and that was the thing that engaged the viewer throughout the trilogy. Not the neverending space battles and fast paced action it's the character development that is the most important part of any film. I hope Disney has realised their mistakes and will decide to make something better in the future. They did The Mandalorian justice so why the the Sequals? I'd say this is a far more tragic story to that of Darth plagueis the wise...
