> even if his part of Last Jedi is pretty weak

So isn't it TLJ's fault for shafting Finn's character? TROS is the last goddamn movie of the whole trilogy, what did you expect that film would be able to do? TLJ dropping the ball on Finn's character (especially the Force sensitivity plotline, TLJ did NOTHING with that) and relegating him to a lame casino planet for 2 hours is something that I will always hold against that movie.
