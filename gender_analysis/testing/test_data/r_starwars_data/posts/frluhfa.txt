He was a terribly written character from the get go, nothing to do with him being black. He was used as slapstick humor most of the time even though he had literally grown up as a child soldier in the fucking empire. Nothing about how he acted made any sense with his past, he didn't care about killing other stormtroopers despite having just been one. He should have been killed off and forgotten, his character was shit. TBH I didn't even watch the third of the trilogy, burn it all.
