It should be noted that Star Wars posters are not known for being overly accurate.

See:  [This one](https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1TlxMmsfhDn4wGIJc1MmhEQ.jpeg)

Luke's pointing a blaster, and no light saber in sight for him. 

Or how about [this one](https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1jw_tyZoU5qoOrOOOvQlBLg.jpeg) where he looks ripped and not like a skinny kid.  And let's not get started on Leia.  

Point is, PR stuff like posters and mag pics before the movie's opening can be misleading.  

I wouldn't get hung up on it.
