As much as I would've liked to see Finn be a Jedi, I think it suits Rey more, especially when you consider her backstory it seems as if Rey being a jedi and confronting her fears to forge her path is the only possible thing that could happen. 

And, although it was small, Finn did lead a stormtrooper uprising. The other stormtroopers who defected most likely did so because of Finn (when he introduced himself to Jannah, she said something along the lines of "that's YOU?", implying that he was what inspired them to turn).

And he wasn't unimportant at all, he was quite crucial to the story in TLJ and TROS too. He screams "REY" like 3 times on the trilogy and that's it, I don't get why that of all things is a criticism. He just wants to protect his friends.
