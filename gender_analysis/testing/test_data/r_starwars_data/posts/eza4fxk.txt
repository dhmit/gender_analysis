I got that the method of unlocking was too high - but a lot of the complaints at the time were people saying they didnâ€™t want to have to unlock these characters at all, they should come already unlocked, which is what happened. 

I just guess I never understood why a comment talking about unlocking things in games became the most downvoted comment in Reddit history when incessant are still out there blaming women for not having sex with them.
