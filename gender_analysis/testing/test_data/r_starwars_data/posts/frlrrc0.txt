Can you imagine a reverse order 66? Palpatine thinking he's gpt this down but there's Finn inspiring the Troppers to rise above what the FO made them, reminding them that Palpatine kidnapped themn brianwashed them and then used them like weapons, their lives dependant on the whims of monsters.

And at the end of it nothing but silence. Then stormtroppers all over the place start kicking ass and taking names, actually hitting the sleezy commanders and taking the ships down from the inside but it isn't enough, all hope seems lost continue with poe and lando scene.
