TBF you can die from a broken heart, it’s what likely happened to Debbie Reynolds after here Daughter, Carrie fisher, died. It’s called taktsubo cardiomyopathy... but yeah I agree that George Lucas fucked up with that particular plot. At the very least he could have included something in the film that showed Palp sucking the life force from her to keep Anakin alive, or Anakin unintentionally sucking her life force. Instead we got “Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.” Common George, why?
