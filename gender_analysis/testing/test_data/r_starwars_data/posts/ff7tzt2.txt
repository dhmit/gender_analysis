Dam no need to be offended. I just know iphone slows down your connections overtime and I've seen countless videos of their apple store tech people charging people 700$ for a cable that fell out to be plugged in. They also got rid of the headphone Jack to sell the same headphone they always have except now wait for it......   its wireless for 150 bucks. Bunch of money grabbers if you ask me.
