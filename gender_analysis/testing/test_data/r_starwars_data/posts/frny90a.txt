Every day I hate episode 9 even more. And 8.

9 was attempting to retcon the 8, and the 8 was retconning the entire thing. Not that it was bad, but instead of going left (more Family-related shit) or right (anyone can be a Jedi), we got garbage middle of everything. 

And a poor movie that should have been 5 hours to properly tell the story.

Every goddamn article explaining shit untold in episode 9 (or 8, or 7) makes it worse.
