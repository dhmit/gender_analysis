Finn had so much wasted potential. Defected stormtrooper who deserted, so much could have been explored with that. Inner conflict, insight on the First Order. Then making him end up being a Jedi would have obviously made sense too. 

Instead, he gets relegated to a funny background character who barely gets to do anything of note, with no character development. 

This entire trilogy was just a stupid waste of potential and lazy writing.
