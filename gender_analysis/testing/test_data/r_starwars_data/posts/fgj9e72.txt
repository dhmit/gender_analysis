The no paper in the Star Wars universe comes from Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game not from Lucas. If you read the Han Solo trilogy by Brian Daley it had references to paper, hell they even showed paper in a comic. So really paper does exist in the Star Wars galaxy in both legends and canon due to Agent Kallus being surprised by it in the book The Rebellion Begins which is canon.
