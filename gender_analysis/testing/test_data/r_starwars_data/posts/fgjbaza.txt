I’m glad they didn’t. What separates the original trilogy from the other stuff, what makes it so special, is the focused storytelling, character development, the pacing, and tone. That’s mostly down to the influence of Marcia Lucas and the work she did in giving feedback during development and the phenomenal work she did in the editing bay. It’s a shame the George bitterly ruined her work and that most people can only see his re-edited “special” editions. The last thing Star Wars needs is just more scenes thrown in, and it desperately needs earlier cuts of the OT to be released so that people can see what made Star Wars great in the first place.
