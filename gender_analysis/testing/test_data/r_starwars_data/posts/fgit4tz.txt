> so ancient they precede the technological age

That was the reason it has been bothering me from the beginning. Paper degrades, it's simple and obvious as that and solution is also simple, why not stone tablets or ancient artifacts. Even holocrons are not out of reach as they could have been converted after.

While that scene isn't the end of the world, it did break my immersion. It is pretty clear that Rian Johnson doesn't care about world building, and it's pretty sad that there was no one besides him that cared either. I don't think he is bad director, he is just not bound to the world and lore which I think is the issue if you are making continuation of the established story. I think he would have made interesting side stories thou.

Anyway downvotes here I come!
