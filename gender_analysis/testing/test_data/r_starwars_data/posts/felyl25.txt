A lot of times, the title of “Executive Producer” is an honorary title. Stan Lee is listed as an executive producer on the Marvel films, despite having zero say on the films’ production. The same is true for Lucas, here. He’s a consultant at most, to offer advice or insight into the world as a director/show runner sees fit, but he has zero creative control since selling to Disney.
