Poe was the natural lead. His place within the story is necessary.

Finn is not.

Now I like Finn. But TFA suffers for following the wrong lead. Poe was originally meant to die in the eacape...but he comes back on his necessity to the plot and Isaacs charisma.

Basically we need to see Poe travel on Jakku and Poe dies. You even get all this character development. Poe has to grapple with a *good person* stormtrooper. Is he really fighting evil or just enslaved people?

TLJ and Tros both dont know what to do with character. Canto Bight is useless and he should die like twice in the movie, but they chickened out of following through.

MORE OBVIOUS STORYTELLING SENSE. Poe is a long time resistance fighter and pilot. A friend of Leia with a criminal past. Natural scoundrel. Make him know Ben. Make him know Han. Theres old jealousy that can be there.
