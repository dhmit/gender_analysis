You know, with all the weirdo nonsense you can’t seem to get right, I can tell it’s like talking to a brick wall. To be honest, you are just some guy on the internet who’s opinion I don’t really care about. Your points are so all over the place they don’t make sense of any kind. Let me give you one example of how you are trying to “re-write” history with Rian Johnson.

1. Anakin’s Mother gets killed. He vows that one day he will be powerful enough to be able to prevent him from dying. Thing this has to do with the Jedi: 0.

2. Anakin has a force vision of Padme dying in childbirth. He will do anything to prevent this from happening. Fault of Jedi: 0

3. [He goes to Yoda for help](https://youtu.be/8EFzrsf_Xnw). Yoda tells him the truth, Death is a natural part of life. Jedi fault: 0

4. Lucas says this about Anakin : "Because he gets attached to things...He can't let go of his mother...his girlfriend...things. It makes you greedy. And when you're greedy, you are on the path to the dark side because you fear that you're going to lose things. You fear you're not going to have the power you need." Jedi fault: 0

5. Anakin betrays the Jedi and here’s the reason: 


Anakin Skywalker: [after killing Mace Windu and in disarray] What have I done?
Darth Sidious: You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
Anakin Skywalker: I will do whatever you ask.
Darth Sidious: Good!
Anakin Skywalker: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her.
Darth Sidious: To cheat death is the power only one has achieved. But if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
Anakin Skywalker: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.

Fault of Jedi: Zero.

So love 8, hate 8. If you can’t understand this tiny part of things, then it’s pointless to keep talking. You don’t clearly want a discussion and I see no reason to keep wasting my time on this.
