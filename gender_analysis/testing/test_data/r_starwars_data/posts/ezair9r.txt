There was a surprising amount of people that came out in support of Unidan not getting banned. But this is Reddit's house, Reddit's rules.

Who cares if a somebody is sniping through walls in a video game, or clickbaits people on YouTube? Video games are just entertainment, and it costs you nothing to watch YouTube. (Well, almost nothing... electricity and a little bit of data if you're on a phone?)

On top of that, upvoting and downvoting aren't supposed to be about the points (otherwise everybody would have their scores tagged right next to their names) they are supposed to help push the on-topic content to the top and the not on-topic content to the bottom. When Unidan used his alt accounts to push possible on-topic comments down just to make his rise, it was more than just generating extra upvotes for him. He was pushing possibly good, on-topic conversation down just to make his rise up faster.

This would be the equivalent of both of us working as unpaid interns at a newspaper and me spilling coffee on your notes on a big story so my article can make the front page. It's not taking anything away from us monetarily, but it isn't an ethically or morally sound action, and in fact would be taking away possibly great content from the "front page".
