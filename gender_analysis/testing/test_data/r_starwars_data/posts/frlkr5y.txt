Problem was they just kept abandoning his storylines.

- love interest for Rey? Nope

- Love interest for Rose? Nope

- love interest for Poe? Nope

- possible Jedi? Kinda, but we don't even get to see it because the series ended

- leads Stormtrooper rebellion? Nah there are a lot of ex- stormtroopers

- sacrifices himself for everyone else? Nope Rose won't let him

They just didn't know what to do with his character
