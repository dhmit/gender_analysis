The Jedi order seemed to have a hall full of holocrons containing information about future force sensitive individuals, I don't think it's too far from understandable that enough of them would eventually be picked up by the first order.

Also people (like Anakin and Rey) were able to live without using the force while being force sensitive for many years, before finally having someone else introduce them to their abilities. 

Without the Jedi going around picking up every force sensitive child in the galaxy common knowledge about the force could easily fall away.
