The Phantom Menace has more miniatures and practical effects than people realize.

But I don't think it's fair statement; there *was no CG* when they filmed the OT. There was a limit on what they could physically do and what they had the budget to do. The prequels (and SE revisions) go out of their way to fill in those gaps with as many effects shots as they can.
