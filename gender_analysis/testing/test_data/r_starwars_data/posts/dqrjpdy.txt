Something I find intriguing is that in Legends the Order had previously become highly restrictive, collapsed due to those restrictions driving people to the Sith (the only real alternative), then been reformed with a looser approach to emotional repression, before gradually becoming highly restrictive again. And I'm pretty sure this happened at least twice before Vader. It's like they just don't learn.
