Well the choice of Tunisia was obviously for thematic reasons (btw the scene were R2 splits off from C3PO was actually Death Valley).

I feel like you're defensive about it being called a british film because you're taking it as a slight or something.  I'm American, I have no agenda in calling it British and I know it's ambiguous, I'm mainly playing.  But also calling it unambiguously "American" when it starred a couple nobody's from America is also as silly.

Lucasfilm was of course an American company but he went to England because no American studio would give him the time of day for his budget.   He went to England because he couldn't get it done elsewhere.    I don't think it's offensive to us Americans to admit that the film is highly british influenced.   The only two actors anybody had even ever heard of at the time (Guinness and Cushing) were English.      The British legacy is still so strong that now all the new stars except Driver are british (Rey/Finn/Phasma/Hux/Snoke).    EDIT: forgot Oscar Isaac, but still mostly british.
