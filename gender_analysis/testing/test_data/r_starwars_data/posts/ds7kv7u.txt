Well, the two ships were awful close.  But, in the previous movie, didn;t old Han jump into and out of hyperspace inside the shields?  And said something like "don't think about it?"  So, yeah, i guess it was on the acceleration run, as Star wars ships go into hyperspace, they don't go past light speed, they go around it, I think?  Thinking about hans asteroid field run when the falcons hyperdrive quit.
