He's mostly interested involved with the rides in the parks at this point.  I used to work at ILM, until last summer.  He sees all the shows and gives feedback,  but it's mostly...a courtesy. Except for the main films. His feedback is taken seriously on those.  The ancillary SW projects, it's a courtesy.
