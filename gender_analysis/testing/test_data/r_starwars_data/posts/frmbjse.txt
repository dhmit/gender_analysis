100%.... the disney star wars trilogy is garbage. Finn had one of the most interesting set ups and I was really looking forward to seeing him develop.  But... China is racist as shit and making him the final point of star wars would have hurt their sales in China so I can't help but think this influenced the "story" (for lack of a better term)
