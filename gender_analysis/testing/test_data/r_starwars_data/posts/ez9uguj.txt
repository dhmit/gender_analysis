AI is good from what we've seen.

Having played galactic conquest a few times this week and having played the old game in general, I feel that people seem to forget that Battlefront II was not the best.

I can't tell you how many times in galactic conquest I had to play a space battle and rinse and repeat taking out the enemies, life support systems, their Shields, their bridge, their engines cooling system, their sensor array.

And don't forget the frigates and taking out the auto turrets all around the ship.
