You know what, they could have had him team up with Rey, and the two could have trained together to push their progress forward faster. Then, when it came time for them to show down with Kylo, who'd been training most of his life, it's more buyable that he could lose, due to being outnumbered by two less experienced, but hard working driven jedi to be. It would lighten how much of a mary sue Reys character is. With careful writing, both could have very strong moments, and you'd have opportunity to put into the story examples of how coming together, and being able to rely on others is a strength in of itself, as opposed to trying to do everything yourself. Which I think the film's touched on but never quite followed through on.
