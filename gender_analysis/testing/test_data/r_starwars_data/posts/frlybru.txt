Nope he never did. What clearly seemed to be framed as a love confession but apparently it was said somewhere that Finn wanted to tell Rey that he's force sensitive.

I speculate it actually was supposed to be a love confession but that part was cut out when they decided to pander to the people that wanted Rey to love the psycho mass murderer.
