> You're criticizing TLJ for things that RoS failed to utilize 

This should've been brought up more in TLJ after they met back up with everyone. But it wasn't. Like he said, they get all that and then go right back to killing all these brainwashed soldiers without regard to anything. They set it up and made a big deal of it, then totally forgot it before the movie even ended! Yeah TRoS doesn't do anything with it either, just like it did nothing with everything else, but you trying to justify that dumpster fire by pointing to the garbage pile doesn't change anything.
