So, in legends they have things like *entire species* that are force sensitive (*cough* Miralukans *cough*) and that the Sith order came from the Sith species; a humanoid race comprising of two sub races: the Massasi - Sith that we’re transformed into hulking warriors by the... Kissai - smaller but strong in the force.

So, in general: yeah it varies, but everyone is “force sensitive” to more or lesser degrees after the prequels.
