Yeah, he's that guy.

I met him at Hi-Dee-Ho comics many years ago, he was there on a Wednesday buying new comics, like you do.

And it happened to be the day that Star Wars Tales #1 (from Dark Horse Comics) came out.  

HE HAPPILY signed my comic and talked to me and every other geek in the store for several minutes.  I mentioned how much I liked the mini-series that he wrote called "The Black Pearl" and he said there was a film option on it (never happened obviously).  The best part though was I asked him about the infamous Hasbro Power of the Force 2 Luke figure (http://jedibusiness.com/images/actionFigures/The-Power-Of-The-Force-2/The-Power-Of-The-Force-2-Luke-Skywalker_Big_2.jpg) and what he thought happened to make him look all buffed out...he laughed...
