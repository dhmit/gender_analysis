Good for Mark Hamill. I think he has a lot of wisdom. I'd imagine that the best part of being a famous actor isn't the money or recognition (though that's awesome too), but being able to bring tremendous joy to a stranger like this, through his fame---that fame can be a means to a higher end, rather than an end in itself.

At the end, when you reflect back on your life, I imagine moments like this---giving joy and comfort to a child at death's door---are the things that make you think *'damn, I lived a good life.'*
