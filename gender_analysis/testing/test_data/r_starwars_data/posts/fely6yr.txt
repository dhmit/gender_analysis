>George Lucas never wanted people to get deeper into Yoda's story, or claim there were other acknowledged individuals of Yoda's species.

While true, that was because (as with the moratorium on PT works before 1999) he eventually wanted to tell that story himself. I feel like the fact that his proteges Filoni and Favreau are now telling that story means that it's at least got his blessing, if not his outright participation.
