There's nothing like learning that the man who played your fictional heroes as a child turned out to be someone you can admire as an adult. It's like "yeah, Luke's not a real person," but Mark Hamill is a 100% good person, and while you can't grow up to swing a lightsaber, he's someone you can look up to and be inspired by.
