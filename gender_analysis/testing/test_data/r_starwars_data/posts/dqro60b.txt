My son who just turned 4 sat down with me when he was about 20 months old and watched Episode 4-6. He never cried never wanted to move just was totally in the movies. I then tried to start him on episode 1 to see how he would react and still to this day he won't watch the prequels. He is now a Star Wars super fan and consistently teaches others the ways of the Dark Side.
