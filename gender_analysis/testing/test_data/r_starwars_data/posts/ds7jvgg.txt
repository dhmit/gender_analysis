The Raddus was a pretty big ship, and it just kinda sliced the first order ships. They were still okay onboard, still able to land and move somewhat. An X-Wing would just kinda bounce off a death star. Need a lot of mass. Maybe you'd be lucky if you could get to the reactor of a death star with a capital ship but still, you'd probably lose less craft just blowing it up the old fashioned way.
