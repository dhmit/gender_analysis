I liked what they did with him until partway through the first movie where he’s blows up an enemy ship and lets out a “yeaAAHHH!!” It just seemed totally weird. It felt like a stereotype. And i just knew, in my gut, they were going to fuck up the good arc they set up.

Though, admittedly, i did always wonder why no one else ever uses a lightsaber.
