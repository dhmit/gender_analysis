Before TFA, when I heard Boyega was on board I was a little dissapointed. I'd seen him in a couple of things before and really wasnt impressed. Coming out of the cinema i was raving about him, saying that his performance was leagues ahead of the other newbies, that his character had so much opportunity for personal and universe  development, giving us a look into the harsh reality of the life under the stormtrooper helmet. I was really looking forward to seeing more of him, so imagine how I felt come TLJ when he was reduced to an incompetent clown, had virtually nothing to do, and none of the potential avenues for the character were explored. I didnt even bother watching ROS, not even pirating it. I just watched the RLM review instead.
