Social media manager as well. I can’t count the number of times I’ve replied to an official tweet posted by me with my personal account. Either to ask the exact question I know the answer will clarify what I couldn’t say in the original tweet, or to give some explanations. Now I manage a few companies in the same sector and make them interact sometimes. People usually love it. « They’re enemies/competitors! :o » Nope just one girl and her Buffer app.
