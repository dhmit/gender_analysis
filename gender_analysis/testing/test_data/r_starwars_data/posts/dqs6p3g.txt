>On a side note Windu was quite “on the line” for a Jedi. I always muse myself that’s why he had a purple light saber. Red and Blue. But I know that’s not why.

That may have originally been an actor request, but it actually was how the character was written in the EU. Mace Windu practiced a rare form of lightsaber combat that emphasized channeling anger into a disciplined style called Vaapad. He in effect "dipped into" the Dark Side for short periods of time while still being able to come back out of it. The purple lightsaber represents this razor's edge that Vaapad users walk on.

I don't know if this was intended for the movies or invented for the EU, but it's still technically canon. Considering the prequel's themes of balance I wish this had made its way into the movies.
