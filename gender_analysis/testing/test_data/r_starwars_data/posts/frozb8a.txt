Read through this thread because I agree with most of it: https://np.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/fgssf8/honest_question_can_you_think_of_any_movie_in/

But if you don't want to do that then it basically comes down to...

Utter lack of world building or a semblance of an explanation as to the state of the galaxy or the New Republic.

The choices they made with the original characters: Han the deadbeat dad, Luke the loser, Leia the defeated

Horrible concepts like Starkiller base and everything about it and everything that happens on or around it.

Rey being so magically gifted that she teaches herself how to use the force within a day of learning that it even exists and then going on to beat Kylo Ren in a light sabre duel.
