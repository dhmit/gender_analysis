I can concur. I was an extra in a TV pilot called It's True and was in a scene with Mark Hamill. This was in a small town outside Vancouver called Fort Langley. Somehow kids heard who was on the set and came with their Star Wars stuff and lined up. Mark signed everything. I recall the PA or Director begged (maybe cajoled) him to return to shooting. 
Funny thing was I did the scene several times, wasn't directly interacting with him. While I was picking over the craft services after several takes, I heard him speaking to another extra and his voice was unmistakable. Best day ever!
