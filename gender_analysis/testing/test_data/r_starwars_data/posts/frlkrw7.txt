That's by design, though.  Palpatine had the ability to mask his own presence as a Force user using Sith magic(and probably the Sith shrine under the temple that clouded the Jedi's judgments). In fact, this actually undermines your point since Palpatine is a perfect example of how far someone who is strong in the Force has to go to hide themselves.
