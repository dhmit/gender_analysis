I hope I don't give the killer vibe. I find Last Jedi interesting to talk about even though I think it ultimately fails.

Here's why the theme was confusing for me: I'm a Star Wars fan, which is why I'm at the theater. The first two acts of the movie - through Kylo and Luke and some thematic choices - are trying to persuade me to 'let the past die'. Luke seems genuinely disgusted that I'd want to watch a movie about 'laser swords'. Kylo and Luke give arguments (that are framed as compelling) on why everything up to this point has been silly. Not what I expected but OK. I guess I'm thinking critically now. Then, in the final act, the movie pulls the rug in the throne room and goes "I guess you were right, Jedi legends are cool, but the film is almost over, so we can't get into why that is right now." 

It's an interesting attempt, but for me it ends up feeling like an unfinished lesson in something I already knew. Maybe it works better for people who are inclined to agree with Kylo and Luke at first? Even then, I don't see what the counter argument in the movie is. The final act just happens because that's where the character dressed in white clothes is supposed to be the bigger badass, even though the emotional core has been against them the whole time.
