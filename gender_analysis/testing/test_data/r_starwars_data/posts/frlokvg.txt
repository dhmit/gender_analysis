I like Rey. It’s probably an upopular opinion around here, but I think she’s a pretty good character and Daisy Ridley does a good job at portraying her. 

With that being said, I really wish Finn had been a Jedi, either of the entire trilogy or alongside Rey. A stormtrooper turned Jedi is such an interesting concept and it’s such a shame they never actually did it. I feel bad for Finn. As the person who made the original post pictured says, he was robbed. 

Speaking strictly about Episode IX, even his arc in Duel of the Fates was more interesting than it was in Rise of Skywalker. At least in that version he led a stormtrooper insurrection against the First Order.
