I recall an interview with Lucas, where he claimed to have creative Input on little details like the names of the planets, and vehicle designs for the new trilogy.

For example: he insisted that none of the vehicles should have wheels and told them to scrap designs that look more like cars.

Also, for what it's worth: Lucas was given a huge number of shares in Disney when he sold the franchise to them, as part of the deal.
