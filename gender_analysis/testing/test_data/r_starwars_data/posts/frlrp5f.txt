The last Jedi truly ruined the new trilogy. Poor JJ set it up for success with TFA and ended up having to pick up the mess TLJ was to piece together ROS. I had so much hope after the force awakens, only to look back at it now and see so much lost potential. I still enjoy them, but they feel like such a wasted opportunity.
