The Jedi aren't Good. The Sith aren't Evil. 

The Jedi are Lawful, and the Sith Chaotic. 

We've been using the wrong axis on the alignment chart all this time. 

Edit for clarification - Most Jedi, certainly most we know of, are definitely Good, and most Sith are Evil. I am referring not to the individuals that make up these groups, but the ideals of the Sith and Jedi themselves. 

This can be seen clearly in the Jedi and Sith codes. One is about balance, harmony, Lawful precepts. The other is about passion, freedom, Chaotic ideals. 

While each group have individuals who would not fit perfectly into their order's alignments as posed by me, I don't think it's enough to alter the Alignment of the concepts they claim to follow.
