That's true enough for their philosophies, but it's still hard to argue that as organizations, the Jedi don't have a general neutral/good inclination and that the Sith don't incline toward neutral/evil.

I'd have a much easier time believing a Chaotic Good Jedi or a Lawful Evil Sith than the other way around... particularly since Sidious pretty much functioned as a textbook LE tyrant and Qui-Gon seemed to be, *at the very least,* Neutral Good with Chaotic inclinations.
