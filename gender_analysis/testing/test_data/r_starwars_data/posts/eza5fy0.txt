This was for the better in the end. The new community manager and dev team really work to provide a good game for the players. It is a shell of the game that it was on release, and I stand by the game to this day. It is extremely fun to play, and has absolutely no pay to win elements implemented. Of course, every game that continuously updates is not without its glitches, but who can complain about a 3 year old game still getting updates? Especially when those updates bring genuine new content... except for weapons :(
