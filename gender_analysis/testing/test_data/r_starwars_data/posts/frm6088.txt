Yes, Force sensitive iirc from Legends is the term that they'd use to describe people who could sense the Force in some way or possibly interact with / use it (partially), but it's implied that they could never use or manipulate the Force in the same way that "Force users" (such as Jedi) could. Am I the only one who remembers there being a clear distinction in terms of terminology between "Force sensitives" and Force users? I thought it was clear and worked well. Also, Force sensitives were supposed to be rare but a lot more common than actual Force users. Many planets (or even races?) might not even have one Force-capable user or Jedi at the moment - that's how rare they were supposed to be. 

I think it's also kind of like describing an allergy. Sure, you could argue that someone with a deadly allergy to peanuts is technically also "peanut-sensitive" (or has a peanut sensitivity). But for ambiguity's sake, you wouldn't want to confuse the two terms because being sensitive to something usually implies something less than fully allergic, otherwise you should probably just say they're actually allergic (and not just sensitive) and be clear about it.
