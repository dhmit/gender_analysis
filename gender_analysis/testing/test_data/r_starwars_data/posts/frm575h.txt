It's not that they didn't know, they just stupidly let the directors write the scripts. It's rare enough a person becomes a competent director, but to also become an competent writer at the same time is extremely rare. The fault lies with upper Lucas film management. George handed them story. All they needed to do was hire solid writers to write the full scipts, and competent directors that wouldn't mess with the scripts. Instead they just bet the farm on JJ and Rian, and then wondered why the franchise imploded. Throwing out the EU v was also a massively stupid decision.
