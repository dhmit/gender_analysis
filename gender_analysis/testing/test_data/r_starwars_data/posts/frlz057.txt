I always thought it would have been nice if Fin was betrayed by Rey.

Imagine Little miss perfect going down the dark path, basically becoming the Azula of the Star Wars world. Finn betrayed by her, has to stand up to her, perhaps he always had a link to the force. Hell he could have been Mace Windus secret son.

The force awakens could have been Rey, Finn, Hann, and Chewie sticking together against Kylo, or some higher threat. Rey learns the force so naturally and quickly it's alarming to Kylo. and her being a natural only fueled Kylos rage in combat.

The last jedi- Finn, Rey, and the resistance + new smaller characters hone in on Snoke, a series of events happens (idk which) but this causes Rey to give into anger a little bit, Unknowing of the true jedi way, she's prone and vulnerable to the dark side. She continues acting "Good" thought but is quicker to lash out at people. Feels okay with using the force on someone. And when Luke refuses to help her she lashes out only further devolving her into a dark place. Whether she attacks Luke or not I don't know. (I'd want him to sucker punched tbh, but perhaps Rey tries to attack him and he overpowers her)

Finn on the other hand knows he has a link to the force somehow by this point, (look I'm not a writer but also just fill in the blanks with your own imagination) either Luke takes him and refuses Rey, causing MAJOR discourse between the two, perhaps even a fight that Luke stops. Finn begins his training as a Jedi

The Rise of Skywalker would be the turning point perhaps 10-15 years pass, they have a funeral for Leia, Rey finally ticks over to the dark side once she meets Palpatine, he would welcome her almost like a daughter, only to feed into her rage against Luke. If Luke's either dead or about to die at this point, perhaps the same way he did, as a force suicide or some shit or whatever. Finn has some training, but is by no means at the point Luke was when he faught Darth Vader. After killing Snoke Rey takes Kylos offer. 

Rey and Kylo set off to find Palpatine from her premonitions or whatever the fuck and want to use him to become stronger. Rey also discovers the family bond, this makes Kylo jealous but not indifferent to them. He still wants to learn but dislikes the favoritism.

Luke, and Finn catch wind of it and begin tracking them down and with some plot later comes to the final showdown. 

Palpatine, old and feeble, Rey, and Kylo facing Luke and Finn Rey is all but gone, blinded by some love for Kylo and her sense of belonging with Palpatine. During the fight though Luke leads it ultimately it leads to the death of Luke Skywalker, Finn screams some cinematic NOOOO and then Kylo, realizing what he's done. Turns on Palpatine killing him too. 

So it's Rey vs Finn vs Kylo duking it out in an awesome 3v3 match to the death, some plot later Finns either knocked down or injured and Kylo uses the force to stop Rey from killing Finn, allowing Finn to role out from under her saber. Finn and Kylo are now on even ground, they turn towards Rey and begin fighting her where she then either gives up, or disappears, or dies.
