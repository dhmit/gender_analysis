That doesn't actually sound too farfetched. It is one of the risks of a univocal, echo-chamberish organization like the Jedi to fall trap of their own dogma even if in the past they may have been open to discussion and development on those very same topics. This happens to a lot of monotheistic religions, you have a lot of philosophical discussion on the one hand, but as time goes on and they become more widespread the tenets that they before try to justify philosophically become doctrine. 

It happens in secular organizations as well. Look at the intellectual environment within Marxism for a clear example (I'm not saying it's *a religion*, inb4, more like the opposite, religions are fundamentally ideological systems).

I always thought that the decadence of the Jedi was one of the handful of (if not the only) interesting aspects of the sequels that I would've actually liked to see fleshed out more.
