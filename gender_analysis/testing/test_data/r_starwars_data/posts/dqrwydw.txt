I always got the impression the Jedi were kind of playing it safe. Like sure they could do more good by letting their emotions rule them but they also risk opening themselves up to temptation. It wasn't that they didn't realise that being free of emotion could have negative consequences, just that on balance it was best.

Not saying I completely agree but I don't think the Jedi are as foolish as you suggest with their reasoning.
