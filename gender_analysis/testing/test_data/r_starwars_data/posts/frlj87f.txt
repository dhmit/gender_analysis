> Rey technically became a Jedi in the end.

It would've been more respectable if Rey established herself as neither a Jedi nor a Sith, but rather as a Grey Force user of sorts walking her own path, instead of ignoring her Palpatine side and larping as a Skywalker. It would've been thematically in line with her character's loneliness.

My biggest problem is that for all the pretense Disney has about marketing Rey as a Jedi, she sure as hell doesn't act like one. She constantly lets her emotions get the better of her, she fights with a wild and unbalanced style, she's full of unbridled rage half the time, and the one time she beat Kylo Ren, she stabbed him in the stomach when he was distracted, like an assassin. This would have been palatable, perhaps even thematically interesting, had the trilogy actually spent time delving into Luke's reformation of the Jedi Order and how his ideals for the new generation of Jedi differed from that of old, but the trilogy never really addressed the Jedi in such a meaningful manner. So given what we know of how Jedi are supposed to act and live, Rey is about the furthest thing from a Jedi without going full Sith. 

There's just this dissonance between the aesthetic of Rey's character and what Disney wants us to think her character is, and I just cannot get over it.
