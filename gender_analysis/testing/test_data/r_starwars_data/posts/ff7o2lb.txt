It’s a big thing with Samsung phones ranging from pink to green lines, normally from damage or small bumps, and cause Samsung supply Apple with their displays, i’d presume there is a similar effect with damage. To be fair i haven’t seen many iPhones like the one shown above, more cracks rather than lcd/oled damage
