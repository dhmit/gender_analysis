I'm personally fine with him not being a Jedi. Not every main character should be a Jedi. These pictures weren't false either, since he does use the light saber. What I didn't like is how his whole ex Storm Trooper subplot is completely snubbed. He doesn't show any remorse for killing Storm Troopers even though he was one, he doesn't attempt to turn any to his cause and he barely seems to remember he was one. It's like they completely forgot what to do with him.
