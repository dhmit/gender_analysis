I was agreeing with your original point about this cut Wampa scene. The RotS comedy is the same way.

It was completely ham-fisted and didn’t match the tone of the rest of the segment. They were sneaking onto a capital ship after a tense dog fight to clandestinely rescue the Supreme Chancellor before being challenged by a Sith Lord. The scene would’ve maintained the dramatic tension if done straight.
