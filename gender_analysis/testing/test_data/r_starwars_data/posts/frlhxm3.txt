Let's all be honest, while we love to hate on the prequels  at least they had a consistent story throughout. The sequels were some of the worst scripts to come out of Disney in years. Terrible character development, lazy dialogue, and just lore breaking plot points on the whole. 
The force awakens was far and away the best of the lot and that was a copy paste of a new hope in reality.
Hope all the stars do well because they all showed promise. Do not want to see them in any more star wars films however.
