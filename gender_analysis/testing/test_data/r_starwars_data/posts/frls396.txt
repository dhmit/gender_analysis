Not that anyone needs this sizzling hot take, but: they just weren't very good movies. Each film had its moments, but taken as a whole, they screwed up. I strongly believe that JJ Abrams was not the correct steward for the franchise.  
  
Still better than the prequels though. Barely. I just know that I'll never intentionally watch any of these films again in the future, which is a sad thing to admit. At least Solo was fun, and Rogue One was good.
