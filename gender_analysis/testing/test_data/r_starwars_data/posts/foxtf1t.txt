Wow, It's great, every time I see a lego construction I resort to this:

My little brother gave me a baby yoda lego figure that he made with leftover pieces, he put it aside on a Chewbacca big head toy that adorns my desk, I never saw it, my nephew saw it and took it apart to play with the lego My brother did not speak to him for three days
