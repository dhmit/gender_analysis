Exactly how I always thought of it. Someone with a small amount of force sensitivity would just pass off as exceedingly talented or lucky.  Maybe they become a professional gambler, or amazing athlete. Maybe they're extremely empathetic and become counselors or psychologists. 

Basically in my mind, a non trained minor force users sensitivity to the force is expressed in ways that already fit their personality and skill set. It's only those with a unique talent and who are taught to express that talent that become magic space ninjas.
