I don't like where Finn's story ended up but this is a dumb tweet and everyone's just using it as a way to air their grievances with the ST. 

Those promotional shots are from TFA. A movie where he does wield the saber multiple times. If you're pissed off that he ended up not being a Jedi, that's your problem, not the movie's. 

I wanted Finn to have a more satisfying arc. He's criminally underused in 8&9. But that's irrelevant to him being a Jedi or not. He still could've had a great arc just as the ex-Stormtrooper turned Resistance member we first met.
