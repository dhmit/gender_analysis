Finn goes from Canto Blight to Snoke's ship, to trying to be a suicide bomber, to fleeing the FO. During that time, he finds that the wise guy he was starting to look up to that has no morals really has no morals, bests his nemesis, and learns to "fight to save what you love, not to destroy what you hate."

Canto also introduced the kid who at the end of the movie was shown using the force. A scene made pointless by the Rey Palpatine crap in RoS.
