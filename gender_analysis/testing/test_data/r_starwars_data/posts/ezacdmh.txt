As far as I understood, though, you could not get again the same upgrade, hence the "40 hours play to unlock everything."  

I agree, though, on the fact that "buff drops" should not be available through RL money, only cosmetics should.  
Most of the noise I heard, though, back then, was about hero characters, and how you could pay and get them before the others.  
Hero characters, though, are usable in game based on your performance in the match (correct me if I'm wrong), so those would be "P2W" only if you're always performing well, in which case you might win regardless.
