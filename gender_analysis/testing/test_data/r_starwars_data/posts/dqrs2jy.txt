It's sad to see this, as Alec Guinness was certifiably A list even if he never did Star Wars. 

He was a part of some of the most culturally relevant films of his generation. He featured or starred in 9 of the BFI's 100 greatest films, none of which are Star Wars.  He was knighted 20 years before the first movie, had his star on the walk of fame 15 years prior.  He legitimately deserves to be in the conversation for greatest British actor of all time.  

I know that with Boomers and younger it is often the case that they primarily associate him with Star Wars, but it doesn't do justice to the massively successful career he had before and after the films.
