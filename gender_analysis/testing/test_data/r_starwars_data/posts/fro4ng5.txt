The people who make the posters aren't even connected to the movie.

They just try to make cool pictures to promote the movies.

So promotion is irrelevant, the bigger problem is with the terrible storylines.

They screwed the movies up, first one was great, second one was lolbad and the third film was just JJ trying to salvage the series.
