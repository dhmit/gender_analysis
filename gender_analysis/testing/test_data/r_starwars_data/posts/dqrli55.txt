Its not just evil that is bad. We need a knowledge of Good and Evil. Most ppl know what evil is, but far less know what good is. As a wise man once said- stop running around trying to do good! Ppl spend their whole lives thinking they were good. But delusions cone in all forms. Much evil co es from not knowing the difference between the two!
