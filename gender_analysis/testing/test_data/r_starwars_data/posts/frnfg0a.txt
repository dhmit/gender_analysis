Whilst I agree the sequels could have been a lot better, it's important to remember that it's easy to just say "this idea would be cool", compared to actually implementing those ideas and making them.  There's so much that goes on behind the scenes in film-making that means what sounds like a good idea in a Reddit comment might not pan out in an actual film.
