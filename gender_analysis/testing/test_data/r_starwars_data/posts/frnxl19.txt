I think both of them should have been Jedi, having a Jedi duo again would have been cool to see, especially them both learning the ropes and striking out on their own paths.

Likely imagine is Finn disagreed with the Jedi doctrine and followed the teachings of Ahsoka Tano, while Rey wanted to follow the Jedi teachings to the letter, and builds to them eventually creating a jedi order that takes from both rather than simply following the doctrine of the Jedi and repeating their mistakes.
