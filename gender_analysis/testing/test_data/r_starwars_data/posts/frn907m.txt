I was glad they did at least confirm more or less he was force sensitive in Rise. Here's hoping there's a chance for a jedi pals /academy movie or show later down the line with Finn and Rey. And I still think Disney should have had the balls to make Poe and Finn a couple. They have obvious chemistry whenever they are on screen together.
