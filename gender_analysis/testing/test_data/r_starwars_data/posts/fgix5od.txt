Okay but hear me out, and I get it’s a sci-fi movie, and all that, but no civilization goes from Stone Age to the technological age. It would be completely normal for an advanced civilization to do away with paper, but to have never had it, and again I realize it’s a movie with space wizards and laser swords that defy any understood laws of physics, just seems like too much of an unnecessary stretch.
