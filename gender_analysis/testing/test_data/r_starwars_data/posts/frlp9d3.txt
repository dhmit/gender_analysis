i have heard that there were story boards revealed of the RoS that he was meant to be a badass that lead a huge battle on coruscant and inspired hope in troops and stormtroopers to where they defect beat the first order. The fact that he wielded a lightsaber in the first movie and despite no trainng could hang with kylo ren for a sec. I even have to say Force Awakens was decent even though a lot said it was just fan serveice which it was i still feel that could have been a good promise of what would come, everything after 7 is not canon to me
