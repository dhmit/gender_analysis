it is a typical jedi plan

just get yourself in the front door and then fuck shit up once you are revealed

jedi talk a lot like non-violent pacifist buddhists monks and  about being centered and controlling emotions but when it comes to strategy and tactics they just have one guiding principal: "spring the trap" or alternately, ["let the force sort 'em out"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caedite_eos._Novit_enim_Dominus_qui_sunt_eius.)
