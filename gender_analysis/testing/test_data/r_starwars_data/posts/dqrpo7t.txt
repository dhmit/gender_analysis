Funny how Harrison Ford somewhat distanced himself from SW whilst Mark Hamill has thrown himself passionately into the role without reserve. Luke in SW is fully committed to the cause whilst Hans thinks it is 'hocus pocus' and is far less interested. In this respect both are following their characters.
