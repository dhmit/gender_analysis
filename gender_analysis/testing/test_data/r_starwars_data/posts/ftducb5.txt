Honestly I think it's due to the bad plot of "Last Jedi." If you take out the second film, cut out all the B.S. between the initial bombing run they can track through hyperspace, and cut back in at the ground assault that's you could still have another hour of storytelling for Finn. We could have the Knights of Ren hunting for the Emperor. Finn fighting Captain Phasma (whom could have had an actual worthy death). Finn could have spent the bulk of 2.5-3.5 searching for allies in the outer planets trying to stay one step ahead of Phasma and learning more about his true abilities and what it means to lead instead of follow and run in fear.
