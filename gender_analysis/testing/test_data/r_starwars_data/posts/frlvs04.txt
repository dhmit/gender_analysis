I dont mind TFA, but i disagree about the setting they created. It doesnt feel like an organic evolution of the franchise especially the new republic. The empire literally started cause they grew an army instead of maintaining one and it was an army that subversed its rule due them being programmed. For the new republic to make the same mistake of not keeping a regularly navy and army instead they made a token peace keeping force, which was the jedi in the old republic.


For someone like mon mothma, leia organa, or admiral ackbar not to keep a regular military in the new republic charter is completely asanine.  I hated the soft reboot cause it didnt make any sense in the context of the prequel or original trilogy.

Don't get me started on tlj.
