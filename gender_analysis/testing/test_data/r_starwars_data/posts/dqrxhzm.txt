Unless you understand that the jedi order was a eugenics program to weaken and diminish the number of force sensitive people that exist.

We know force sensitivity is genetic, and the whole structure of the jedi order was to ensure that the most powerful force-sensitive individuals were never able to reproduce.

Jedi order was either stupid or cowardly in their own way, and utterly fails as a role model as a result.  Sith are evil, sure, but Jedi are just as self-serving and authoritarian.
