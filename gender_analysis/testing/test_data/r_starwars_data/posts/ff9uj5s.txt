I have it on pc, but every time I play, it breaks in someway including my first play. Recently I just couldn't proceed because a door that was supposed to open wouldn't, so I downloaded a mod to force it open and that forces me to kill the people behind the door instead of talk it out. My original game, late into it, my party slowly turned into the wookie. I had 7 of my party members turn into him before I gave up on it.
