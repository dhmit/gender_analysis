> And it still bothers me that Poe just disappears after the crash, returning to the rebel base, and Finn just happened to grab his jacket so he could walk with it in the middle of a desert just so BB-8 could recognize it later.

Poe disappeared because he was originally supposed to die in that crash. Somewhere along the line they changed their minds and wrote him back in, but didnâ€™t bother to adjust the rest of the movie to reflect that.
