What in the world are you talking about? It’s clearly shown he deserted because of watching his friend die and watching those village people be executed (which makes no sense given that soon after he switches sides he happily kills left and right with no remorse but that’s another matter). It is then VERY HEAVILY implied in the last movie that he realized he’s a force sensitive which is what he wanted to tell Rey. All the other former stormtroopers they find in that movie mention they were just more abducted children put in the same platoon who also realized the evil army that abducted them to use as soldiers to terrorize people is bad. They have no indication of having anything to do with the force.
