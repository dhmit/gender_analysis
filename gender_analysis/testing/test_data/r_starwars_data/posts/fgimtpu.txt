This is a fun, silly scene. It shouldn't be there.

It takes place in the middle of the Hoth evacuation. It is supposed to be a tense sequence - starting from "General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four" pretty much all the way to when Luke gets to his X-Wing (or when the Millennium Falcon takes off). This whole chunk of the film is a carefully-paced, action sequence, which builds up tension (with a couple of outlets), puts the main characters under quite a bit of pressure, has quite a bit of death (of good guys as well), and has a fairly sombre outcome (the good guys lose; sure, many of them escape and survive, but their base is destroyed and a lot of them die). It's not the kind of sequence you want to throw jokes into.

There is some humour in there (as there is throughout the OT), but it mainly comes from the characters being themselves; particularly Han Solo making one-liners and quips at people - but that's what he does, and fits with his character (the more serious he gets, the more he tries to deflect with insults etc. - Leia does the same). And for this part of the time, it all happens while furthering the plot in some way. The one exception is C-3PO being dragged through the door after it shuts in front of him - and personally I find that shot a little jarring and out of place.

This shot (the wampas and Snowtroopers) requires three bits in the film to make it work; something to establish the Rebels have captured Wampas or have a problem with Wampas getting into parts of the base (iirc this was in the script at some point, not sure if it was ever filmed). Second, we need the set-up of C-3PO removing the sign during the high-stakes race to the Falcon. Third, we need the pay-off when the Snowtroopers, chasing the Rebels, open the door. That's three decently-long shots or bits of script dedicated to a joke, which aren't furthering the plot.

Finally, this sequence involves C-3PO acting out of character. Why would he remove the sign? That would go against protocol, surely? Why does he stop when in danger of being left behind? We don't even care about the Snowtroopers being mauled by wampas; maybe if it slowed them down for a bit longer and that had a clearer pay-off later it might work, or if someone other than C-3PO had removed the sign (showing sneakiness and cunning - not traits 3PO is known for). But as it is, it doesn't quite fit.

So for that scene to be included, we have to break the drama, add in 2-3 extra shots with no plot reason, have to pull someone out of character, all for a single joke where the punch line is some random Snowtroopers getting attacked by a wampa arm.

I'm glad someone said no to that scene. I wish there was someone like that working on the Prequels and Sequels to say no to some of the random jokes.
