My "I'm an awesome dad" moment came not but a year ago when my daughter was 2 and she wanted a Vader Mask form the store. When she wore it at home she'd chase me around trying to make his breathing sound... words could not express my joy LOL!!! Now I cannot get out of Target without a good 5-10 min saber fight in the toy aisle =D
