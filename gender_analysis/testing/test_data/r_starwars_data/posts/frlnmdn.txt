This is why, while I loved what Rian Johnson tried to do with TLJ, the entire trilogy should’ve had a single, unified director/producer team. 

MCU did so well connecting all its movies together into an overarching and sensible storyline, including well after Disney acquired them. And even the Original Trilogy managed to do this. It blows my mind that they couldn’t keep things straight with the sequel trilogy. So much lost potential.
