Han Solo wasn't a Jedi, but he wielded a lightsaber to save a Jedi's life (even if it was cut a Tauntaun open). 
If I'm not mistaken, these images were for TFA and no one knew what the plot would be. If they show Rey with a lightsaber, they had to show another known character with a lightsaber to keep things spoiler-free.
