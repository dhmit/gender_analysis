Most underrated character IMHO in all of star wars. Lando, who had a fraction of screen time that Finn has had (comparing OT to ST screentime), had more of a character arc than finn, which is crazy to me. How can you have a main character with plenty of screen time go absolutely no where with an arc. He had the most interesting story out of all of the new characters IMO and he just continuously got pushed towards the back. He went from defector, to spy, to friend(?) in the trilogy. I like Kylo, and Po shined way to late, and Reys mysterious past kind of overshadowed her potential for an amazing story. But Finn feels like such a flop. I'm sorry John Boyega. You and finn deserve more.  I partially want them to make another trilogy or something of time after the first order where I can actually see some of these great ideas for characters turn into actual great stories.
