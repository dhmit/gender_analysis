I feel like Finn was robbed in terms of his story but I am glad he wasnt a Jedi and I do not like him being force sensitive. Before TFA came out I just knew that they were doing a bait and switch. I had a feeling Ret was going to be the force sensitive one they focused on. 
They had so much potential with Finn to tell a really compelling story of him being taken as a child and raised as a Stormtrooper and gave him a true rivalry with Phasma. 
They could have paralleled his and Reys story and journey, two orphaned kids with their own fates intertwined that they help each other with yet must face alone. 
Yeah they screwe him over but still...glad he isn't a Jedi.
