As someone that doesn't hesitate to point out flaws in the sequel trilogy, I'm actually okay with a lot of those storm troopers being force sensitive. That dude wasn't kidnapping random orphans to turn into stormtroopers. He must have been selecting them off of some kind of criteria which happens to overlap with force sensitivity. But I do have an issue with the scale of the force that that the FO was able to put together in the first place.
