While i agree, the Jedi thought they were helping their purpose. They know that being too emotionally involved can lead to the dark side. Like trying to save a loved one.

I think people do sometimes go a bit far the other way. THe Sith are evil. they are perfectly willing to enslave people to help their cause. They'll kill, blackmail, torture or whatever. They believe in power through fear. They're evil.

The Jedi were good, but just did it in the wrong way. They tried so hard to avoid the dark side that they ended up ignoring it sometimes.
