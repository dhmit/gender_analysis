The formula wasn't the issue, the shitty jokes that kept ruining any tention the movie built was.  Like I enjoyed the themes, the suprises, the changes ect. but I kept being thrown out by stupid jokes, oneliners and slapstick.

One example is when Rey cuts the rock, Im thinking this is kinda tense, she let go, went darker, does this mean something?  No it just hits some dumb animals cart and they get angry.
