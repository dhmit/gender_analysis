Right, but being fair, a lot of people make this comparison just to be edgy. Not saying that is what you're doing but the Sith are criminal murderers. They killed people arbitrarily, use firing squads, consistent torture, holocaust of the Jedi (which included the murder of children), etc.

As problematic as some of the Jedi portrayals can be, the Sith basically do embody evil.
