A question for all of you: Would you rather be forever famous for one role you did really well (example: Hamill as Luke in star wars, Michael Richards as Kramer from Seinfeld) or a middle of the line actor that's in a bunch of movies but never has a role that springboards them to the top like the others that are remembered for one role.
