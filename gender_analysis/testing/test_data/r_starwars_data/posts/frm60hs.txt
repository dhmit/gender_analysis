My understanding is balance in the force is like regression of the mean where since the empire spent all those years killing all jedi and most force sensitive beings that there would be an influx of new force sensitive beings to take their place.

I could be completely wrong but that's how it makes sense to me even tho i still don't think it actually makes that much sense
