You don't need to sacrifice large ships... You just take a ton of mass and put a drive on it, aim it at what you want to blow up and flip the switch - bam, you got ship killers for the cost of a hyperdrive... 

Your scrapmetal+ and a not-that-large hyperdrive for seriously damaging one of the FO biggest and best armed ships? Quite an easy choice...
