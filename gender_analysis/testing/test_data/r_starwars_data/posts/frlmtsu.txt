The sad Truth is, We wanted Finn to be a sympathetic Imperial character

A loyal soldier whose ideals clash with the cold truth of the FO's rhetoric 

in practice Finn is not an ex stormtrooper,, He is an innocent forced into servitude that flees the first chance he gets and thats just the thing we have to come to terms with.

I agree that Finn should have been a Jedi character... but the ST was so afraid of Rey being overshadowed by anybody that by the end the only character that mattered was Rey and Kylo

Granted the problem isn't so much Finn's wasted potential but how Cartoonishly EVIL the FO are that no character can really derive nuance from them.

Hence why Finn is a Soldier but they go out of of his way to make sure he hasn't killed anybody and has deep misgivings about killing people 'cept his fellow stormtroopers... Whoops'

Like a big issue with the ST is the FO are just so obnoxiously in your face EVIL that a big part of why a certain someone's who redemption arc falls apart is he basically just goes along with these bozos and then runs them exactly the same.
