I disagree strongly. The lack of emotion, and therefore the lack of desire, is the true source of happiness and peace. Only from not wanting things can we be at peace. There is always something more to want. When you want something you can't have, it leads to ambition, which leads to anger and ruthlessness, which leads to hate. Some people display it more than others, but it's a fairly constant rule.

Goodness is not "let's do as much good as we can." This leads to unhealthy ambition which is a time bomb. Goodness is balance, harmony, and stillness.
