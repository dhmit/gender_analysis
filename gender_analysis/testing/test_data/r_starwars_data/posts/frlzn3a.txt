Mmmm it’s almost as though they made up the story as they went along based off of feedback from focus groups and folks without any respect for the carefully crafted lore and universe. Then funnily enough they also  happened to have little posters like this one to help with the diversity quotas, or so it seems... 

I agree it was an absolute shame to waste John how they did, his character had so much potential. Instead they turned him into a beta simp... 

Fin was a deserter who wielded a light saber against bad ass vibro blade storm trooper and then Luke skywalkers star pupil.. all of this without any training...  but then in the next movie he was suddenly a coward ?? Man weren’t my expectations subverted .... 

But I wouldn’t say his character arc was any more or less bungled than Luke’s... or Poe’s..... or Klauds.
