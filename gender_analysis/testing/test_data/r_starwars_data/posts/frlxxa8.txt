I don't know, there's a lot of room even with FO being hilariously evil for Finn to be more interesting.

For one, if him being the main character instead of Rey would, in my opinion, vastly improved the story. Some nobody stormtrooper switching sides to eventually save the day would have actually been a bit of a subversion of the ongoing dynastic saga that starwars has going on.

Whether or not you change the FO, just making Finn the central character, and a Jedi, adds a lot to the mix in the context of all 3 movies that is kind of shot by the cyclic repetition Rey is there to provide.


I would agree that it would be a lot more interesting for Finn to have any kind of moral crisis, but I don't think it actually requires the bad guys to be some kind of "shades of grey" from a morality perspective.

Finn could have felt terrible about killing his fellow stormtroopers, or have killed innocent people along the way to escaping being a stormtrooper, or both.

IMO, the reason he doesn't is simply because he's planned as a particularly important character in the long run, and he really exists as a vehicle for Disney to check off a list of plot, casting, and call back requirements.


Because well, the new movies are interested in evoking nostalgia, taking some cheap shots at the previous series', and pulling 'gotcha' moments where it seems like the writers or director are just jerking themselves off.
