The more I think about and read about the ST the more I hate them. Maybe they’ll grow on me like the prequels but i kinda doubt it. It also seems like Disney/Lucas Film would rather us move on too. I wonder how long until Star Wars is rebooted  again and the ST would move to the category of Legends?

It seems SW is in good hands now and any future movies shouldn’t be shit.
