It's interesting. This is a fictional order that was originally designed as the bad guys of a movie, and yet there's practically a philosophical debate going on about it, decades later. I'm going to do my duty and jump on into this debate, because I actually love this topic and I love all of the lore written for it over the years.

I read pretty much every book and played pretty much every Star Wars game, etc. I actually *really* liked the Sith. Yeah, part of this is because I was a depressed, bullied kid, and the idea of anger and hatred leading to strength was *very* appealing to a kid that was full of anger and hatred (I'm trying *so hard* not to be overly edgy here). And yeah, to deal with the bantha in the room, my name is General_*Sith*. I like the Sith philosophy. Notsomuch the "murder all the kids" part though. This is going to be long. Because I'm weird or something.

Overall... Yes, the Sith are evil. Throughout their history, the Sith were responsible for truly terrible things. *However*, the basic ideology, like many in the real world, is not evil. For this next part, I'm going to completely ignore the fact that this is a story and treat it as if it is reality.

The Sith utilize the Dark Side. We're not at "evil" yet. Despite the Jedi constantly stating that the Dark Side is evil, it's *not*. Even specifically using the Force to kill is no more evil than using a blaster or lightsaber to kill, *from an unbiased point of view*. The only reason to consider it evil to use the Force as a weapon is based on the religion of the Jedi.

The Sith believe that the Force can and should be used to achieve power and freedom. Not evil. Same reason as above.

The Sith believe that the strong should rule. *Still* not evil, by itself. Weak rulers result in weak civilizations, which will be destroyed or manipulated by the first *strong* civilization that finds them.

The Sith believe that the ends justify the means. While definitely gray, still not evil. At this point, it's a matter of *what the ends are*. A man sacrificing a child simply to gain personal power, for the reason of having personal power, is evil. A man sacrificing a child to gain personal power *that he needs to save the lives of everyone on his planet* is not evil, even though it might very well shatter the sanity of most people that do that based on what *we* consider to be moral (I doubt I could do that, even knowing what's at stake).


Generally, many mistake "unethical" and "immoral" for "evil." Those are different things. An unethical man may be shunned, but an evil man should be executed... but depending on who you ask, it will take an unethical man to execute an evil man.


Now then, if none of that makes the Sith evil, *what does*?

> Sith Lords murdering children to absorb their Force energy to heal themselves or to power up.

> Sith Lords murdering their parents or their in laws, attempting to murder their sisters and killing their cousins to gain prestige and military power

The ends.

The thing to think about is that the Sith Order is not inherently evil *in concept*, but throughout its history it is ruled by evil beings. The Sith Order is evil because its beliefs allow for evil to grow. A good man can be a Sith, but an evil man won't hesitate to kill that good man to become stronger. Once ruthless murderers firmly entrenched themselves within the Sith, they could train all new Sith to think like them. And so you have an ideology that is not evil, but an army of murderers that will do anything for power and are *encouraged* to murder their comrades to gain power and so are evil.


As for the Jedi... in many ways, I view the Jedi the same as the Sith. The difference is that they manipulate instead of execute.

They set themselves up as *the* army of the Republic in ancient wars against the Sith. They fought in wars against other enemies as well. They firmly entrenched themselves in the Republic hierarchy. Even when they didn't actively involve themselves in politics, they still acted as police and "peacekeepers."

They have no qualms about using the Force to trick the minds of weaker beings... even though the Force shouldn't be used to do harm and the idea of only the strong ruling is wrong? But it's okay because they do it for important reasons right? It's almost like... the ends justify the means? But they don't use the Force to murder people... They simply use it to manipulate people and remove the free will... and it apparently only works on those who are weak, which somehow makes it okay.

But at least they don't sacrifice children to improve their own power! Instead, they have force-sensitive children sent to their Order, and never allow them to develop ties to their families. They then proceed to train them in the ways of the Jedi. And if those kids aren't good enough to be Jedi Knights? The Jedi send them off to work on farms or work in some other way to help the Jedi or the Republic.


The reason the Jedi are viewed as good and not evil is because their beliefs fit the Republic's beliefs well enough, and the Jedi don't overtly murder hundreds of people.



**Now then**. From a *real world* perspective, the lore for the Jedi and Sith have been written beautifully for the most part, and they mirror real world political and economic systems quite well. The real world also shows why the sith are evil... Because the protagonists need enemies. Some writers have written stories where the Sith aren't complete baby-killing monsters, and those stories are phenomenal. Some have also written from third party views (think Republic Commando novels), and gave views of the Jedi other than "SAVIORS OF THE UNIVERSE!" I enjoyed those.


The thing to remember is...

The Sith philosophy is not evil, though it may be unethical. It does enable evil easily. There is a distinction there.

Additionally... *Light and good are not synonyms. Dark and evil are not synonyms.*
