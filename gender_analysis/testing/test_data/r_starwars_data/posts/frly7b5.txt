I never cared about Finn; I was left wondering why he was even in the movies.  As it turns out, I just didn't pay enough attention to the advertisements, so this silly Jedi fake-out thing was lost on me.  

He easily could have been a Jedi; he was just as qualified as Rey. He even wielded a lightsaber proficient with absolutely no practice.  You're right, he probably deserved more.
