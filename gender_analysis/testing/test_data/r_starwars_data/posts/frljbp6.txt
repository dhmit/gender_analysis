TLJ made Finn realize that good and evil isnt always as simple as Jedi vs Sith or rebels vs Empire.  It also made him realize fighting for good and for love is more important than fighting against what you hate.  These building blocks couldve been capped well with the establishment of a "gray" Jedi order, as Last Jedi seemed to be building toward.  

I agree that the casino stuff wasn't handled nearly as well as it could've been, but the character beats were solid.  ROS dropped the ball on everything TLJ built up.
