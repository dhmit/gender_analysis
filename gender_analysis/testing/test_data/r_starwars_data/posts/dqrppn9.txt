I'm honestly okay with a few minor criminal acts, we're all human and our emotions get the best of us sometimes. I'm sure in both instances he probably paid up without much fuss. Honestly, it just kind of reminds me of Cool Hand Luke for some reason...

Speaking of which, I need to throw Paul Newman on my list too, what an absolute national treasure that guy was. He was faithfully married to his wife for 50 years, and was noted for once saying, "Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?" when asked if he was ever unfaithful. Not only that, he was a huge philanthropist. His Newman's Own line donates all of it's profits (after taxes) to charity. Further, he is known for his extremely progressive views, and attended the March on Washington in 1963. Even further, he was so cool that he was placed on Richard Nixon's "Enemy List"
