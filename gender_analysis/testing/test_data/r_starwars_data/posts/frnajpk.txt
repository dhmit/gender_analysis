As someone who likes the sequels, I have to absolutely agree! A former Stormtrooper, who joins the Resistance, becomes a Jedi and then leads a Stormtrooper uprising would have been so much more interesting than the story Finn ultimately got! I have nothing against Rey and her story could have largely still happened the same way, but Finn had so much more potential...
