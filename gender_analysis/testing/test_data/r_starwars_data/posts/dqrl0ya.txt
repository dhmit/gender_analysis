I've been a massive fan of Mark hamill since I was a kid but I didn't learn of him from the traditional means... infact I didn't even watch Star Wars until I was 15-16. 

Instead I came to know Mr. Hamill from Wing Commanded 3 - 4 (heart of the tiger though). From those I became a huge fan of him and moved on to Star Wars.

But from what I've seen and his love and devotion to not just fans but humanity itself.
Well sir, too me he is what Luke himself very much should be.

That's why when people talk of Luke going to the dark side as his father did, I don't think it fits the actor who has very much become the embodiment of this character. I'd rather see Luke die in a blaze of fire then become evil.
