Who are you to say that I'm not allowed to enjoy a story about a person I like doing one of the things that makes me like him? I am taking joy from this story in an otherwise stressful and long Monday.      
       
my faith in humanity is as low as it was this morning, Just a nice reminder that Mark Hamill exists and is part of the reason it isn't lower. now go be insufferable elsewhere.
