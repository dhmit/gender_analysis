IDK... in star wars, there are hyperlight routes that are premade or at least precalculated, and if something is in the way, they would still hit it, according to Han in ANH... I think the reason people don't do this normally is 1) the ship your attacking has to be in line of a hyperspace route - which this one is because its tailgating a rebel ship coming out of hyperspace. I think normally they move away from the hyperspace routes once they "drop out."


2) this probably ruins the hyperspace route until its cleaned up, and it probably makes a lethal travel hazard for whoever comes near it next.
