Ya have to understand, JJ Abrams is a hack. He doesn't have more than a superficial understanding of what makes a genre or universe click with an audience, so his films seem cheap ripoff of good movies. It was like that with his Star Trek re-make, his entries in the SW set, Cloverfield. Even Super 8 was nothing more than Abrams' cheap imitation of a Spielberg movie and you knew it as you watched it unfold.

He didn't and couldn't understand why Finn should have been something more than what he ended up as.
