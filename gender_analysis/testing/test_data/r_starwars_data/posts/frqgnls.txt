"You don't clearly want a discussion," like I wrote two thousand words of critical analysis because I hate arguing. You don't get to make this personal and quit in a huff but still blame me. 

But apparently Yoda telling Anakin the Jedi don't care about death has nothing to do with the Jedi, so what do words even mean? It's not like the Force has any supernatural powers after life, cough cough, Force ghosts, Darth Plagius, Palpatine clones. The Jedi effectively leaving life-saving magic for the dark side couldn't *possibly* contribute to him choosing the dark side.

Anakin's own virgin conception is proof that the Force can create life. Jesus!

Nevermind Anakin's animosity toward the Jedi council is a running joke at this point. Mace Windu in particular is the guy who shows up to kick Palatine's ass. You know, "take a seat, young Skywalker," Mace Windu? Wasn't exactly a tearful betrayal when Anakin chops his hand off. 

I actually pulled out my AOTC DVD to check this - after the nightmare about his mother, Anakin says: "I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, senator, but I have to go. I have to help her." In case it wasn't obvious enough that he connects Jedi apathy to traumatic events in his life. His next order is to stay on Tatooine, leaving Obi-Wan in danger. "He's like my father," Anakin says. "But Master Windu gave me strict orders to stay here." 

All of these people are supposedly clairvoyant empaths.

He's only in the Jedi Order because of a Jedi prophecy that Qui-Gon heard. His first impression of them is, they tell Qui-Gon not to train him, because they 'sense fear in him.' He spends all of AOTC hiding a relationship with Padme, because the Jedi have some vow of celibacy now. Even his relationship with Obi-Wan is strained because he thinks his master is holding him back. George Lucas wasn't subtle about this. Anakin's completely understandable human desires getting slapped down by the Jedi was kind of important to the plot.

But hey.

For argument's sake - because apparently I can't stand a discussion - let's say you're right. Let's say Anakin's just strongly inclined to be horribly fucking evil. Totally normal events in a space wizard's life led him to be the strutting embodiment of malicious power. How does that not still justify Luke's concern about Kylo? If becoming a genocidal monster thanks to love and mortality is something the Jedi way just can't fix, what was he supposed to do, stroke his beard with concern and watch Damien Solo get more powerful?

Meanwhile, still wondering which parts of 8 you think are plot holes, lost subplots, or deus ex machinas. The movie has abundant problems. Not those in particular. 9, though - woof.
