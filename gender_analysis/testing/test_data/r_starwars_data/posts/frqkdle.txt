Did you watch the clip I sent? No, of course not. So let me spell it out for you (sorry for the all caps) ANAKIN WANTS THE IMPOSSIBLE. How could the Jedi have stopped Padme from dying? Palpatine even lies saying he could do it. You are missing a huge an important part of the story: It’s everything that Anakin does to save Padme that kills her. After hearing the horrible things he has done, she dies of a broken heart. Had Anakin listened to Yoda, everything would be fine. I find your reasoning weird. The Jedi don’t even know how to become a force ghost UNTIL THE END OF THE MOVIE (ROTS), and Palaptine tells Anakin he doesn’t know how to prevent her death, but if both of them can work together they can “figure out the secret”. If Windu kills Palpatine that means: No Sith, No Vader, No Order 66, No Empire. Are you sure you actually watched AOTC? Anakin is with Padme because there were two terrorist attacks against her. The Jedi have entrusted her protection to Anakin. Once he tells Padme he has to go rescue his mother, he gets there as she is dying and then gives in to his anger and hate and wipes out an entire village of Tuskin Raiders: Men, Women, and children. The Jedi would not condone an action like this. You can even hear Qui-Gon say “No, Anakin. No!” Before he strikes the first raider. Anakin has a high ranking government official with him. She is not a soldier and he’s suppose to protect her, not lead her into more dangerous situations. Notice he takes her to the location of the people that want to kill her (The Trade Federation). I’m really not trying to be mean, but these seem like things you say seem to come from a lack of knowledge. Let me make one thing extremely clear: This is not a “I’m right/your wrong” situation. I answer things from what Lucas has said/Behind the scenes material/books/ etc. Also, so you are telling me The Last Jedi has no plot holes, etc? It’s a flawless masterpiece? I gave a quote from Lucas himself and had a video I sent you where he further elaborated on the subject. But hey, if you love 8 that’s your vision of Star Wars you like, by all means continue with whatever suits you.
