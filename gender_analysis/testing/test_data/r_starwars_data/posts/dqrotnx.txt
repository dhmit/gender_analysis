Except that's clearly not how Jedi actually work. Did any Jedi we see were actually devoid of emotion? Did Obi Wan, a widely touted model Jedi not say "You were my brother Anakin. I loved you"? Did Master Yoda, the grand master of the Jedi Order not feel any sadness or a feeling of loss during the Jedi purge? Heck did any Jedi not care about how all their brothers and sisters were killed?

The Jedi teaches self control of emotions and how they shouldn't be controlled by emotions. As we can see what happens when you don't control them, as Anakin clearly showed.
