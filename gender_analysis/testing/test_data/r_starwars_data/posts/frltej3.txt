I sort of like the idea of there being force users that aren't Jedi/Sith, like Chirrut, for example.  He's definitely got some sort of Force sensitivity, but doesn't seem to be trained, relying mostly on it for instincts and sight, as opposed to being a Jedi that can lift things or use mind tricks.  

The thing is, I feel like those kinds of people have to be pretty rare, since we really don't see many at all prior to the sequel trilogy.
