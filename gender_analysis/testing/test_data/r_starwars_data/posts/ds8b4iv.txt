That’s a good point. Perhaps the shields would block anything too small to penetrate via lightspeed. Who knows though, lol. I’d love to hear the official word from the big mouse. I would *hope* they would have thought it through very thoroughly before putting in the movie as such a pivotal moment! And yea, goood lord I loved that scene. The silence followed by the sound coming back...fucking amazing.  The sound team behind Star Wars just has to be some of the best in the biz.
