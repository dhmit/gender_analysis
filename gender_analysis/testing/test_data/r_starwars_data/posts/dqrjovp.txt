Yeah, but we'll never know if Yoda had any secret force healing powers because Anakin never got the chance to talk about the visions with anyone who might have had such powers, primarily because of the taboo. 

Not that I'm disagreeing with your point; Palpatine says no Jedi have that kind of power, essentially. But we never got the chance to find out if he was lying because of the taboo, at least how I see it.
