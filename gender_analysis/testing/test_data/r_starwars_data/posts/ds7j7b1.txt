Logically it makes sense. If you have the ability to go to light speed the way that has been shown in the rest of the series then you should be able to destroy entire fleets just like that. The problem is that no one in the past has destroyed fleets just like that and if it were that easy then everyone would be doing it, so there must be some reason it isn't possible. The problem is not that what they did would not be possible given the circumstances, the problem is it so violently contradicts the entire rest of the series that is doesn't make sense.
