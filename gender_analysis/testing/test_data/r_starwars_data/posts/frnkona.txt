Maybe it has something to do with the female empowerment thing going on? Originally Finn May have been the one to be a Jedi but Disney decided it was better to have a female lead?

I’m only speculating but I’m sure Disney makes a fair amount of casting and story direction choices based on gender and political issues going on at the time to drive sales up. But again I don’t follow any of this so I’m only guessing.
