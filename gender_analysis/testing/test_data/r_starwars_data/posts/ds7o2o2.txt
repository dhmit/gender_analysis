The cruiser in TLJ took out a small group of Star Destroyers. You could build a hyperspace missile out of a big chunk of steel, a hyperdrive, and some shields. It would absolutely be cost effective.

Also, they sent literally millions of droids to be destroyed by clones and Jedi. I don't think they're all that worried about running out of materials.
