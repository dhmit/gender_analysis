Guess I struck a chord guys. Hell, I was even being political with my original comment. Fuck it, I'll just say the truth then . . . it's fucking disgusting that the original twitter poster would recount this in hopes of "5 seconds of fame" and just as disgusting for OP here to revitalize it for imaginary internet points. Finally, to truly drive the point home, I'M BEING A "KILLJOY"?!? ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!?!? YOU ARE TAKING JOY FROM THIS STORY?? oh sorry, forgot #faithinhumanityrestored
