They literally could've just removed Rey entirely and had Finn lead a Storm Trooper insurrection and made 3 movies about that. The whole First Order being in another corner of the galaxy, without having to force in any of the old characters that either passed away due to age or something along those lines. First movie, same story about Kylo Ren, except being the founder of the First Order and gaining momentum with old Empire loyalists. Bad guys win. Fast forward a few years, second movie with Finn taking the stage as the main character, half the movie being his teenage years growing up in the First Order as a stormtrooper, thinking of it at first as just following orders and being basically a drone, until he wakes up one day realizing he's being ordered to gun down innocent civilians, movie ends with him inspiring others in his garrison to overthrow their superiors and liberate whatever world he's on. Third movie being the full rebellion.

Could've even shoehorned in some propaganda shit about the working class since all the new trilogy is is feminist stuff anyway.
