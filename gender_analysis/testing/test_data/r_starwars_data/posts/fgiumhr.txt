Oh interesting. Would it be that scene where Luke described the mistakes of jedi order? Which he rejected those same doctrines in episode 6 when he saved Anakin. Or are you talking about holdo maneuver which raises more question than answers. Or when the text crawl that starts The FIRST ORDER reigns, bringing more questions without answers? Or ww2 fragile bombers?

He has set scenes he has in mind that he want in his movie, he pretty much acknowledge that in interviews
