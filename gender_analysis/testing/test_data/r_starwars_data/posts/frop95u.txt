I’m sorry, I thought that you where talking about the Millenium Falcon in TFA. But just remember, there is a year between TFA/TLJ and TROS. A lot can happen between those two. 

And, correct me if I’m mistaken, but I don’t think that you are very experienced with sword fighting right? If you know the basic moves, how to move, how to attack, how to defend, and you apply those to a stick it doesn’t change that much. The biggest change is just the way you take up the weapon. A sword, your hands collide to each other, a stick far from each other. Other then that basic moves are kinda the same. There are a few different moves and it’s only when you start focussing on 1 specific fighting style that it becomes more complicated. But you can see very clearly that Rey has no fighting style and that what she does is just what she though was the most effectief way to use it. You can see that in her moves, defense and the way she walks during the fights.
