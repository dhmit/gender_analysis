>being devoid of emotion doesn't make you good. it makes you impassive and neutral, which can be just as bad as being evil if it serves your purpose. 

I think there's an important distinction between 'being devoid of emotion' and 'being in control of your emotions'. The former is about suppressing something, whereas the latter is about acknowledging it but letting it out in the right way at the right time.

I think the world would unquestionably be a considerably better place if more people were in control of their emotions.
