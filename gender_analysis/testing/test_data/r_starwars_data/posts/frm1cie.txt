Honestly, this is such a lazy excuse that kinda shifts blame off Disney, which is just asinine.

Disney is 100% to blame here, not China. After all, Black Panther was almost entirely composed of black people, yet that movie did exceptionally well in China. That's because Marvel movies have a strong presence in China's pop culture, and Black Panther was simply a continuation of Marvel's brand. 

Star Wars, meanwhile, never even showed the Original Trilogy in China. It was never going to do exceptional numbers over there, yet Disney still felt the need to capitulate to a market that doesn't really exist. So not only could Disney not be arsed to do market research, they somehow thought that Chinese people would care heavily enough about the racial casting of the main character that they let it influence their creative decisions when it came to Finn's character. THIS is corporate fuckery at its absolute worst, and Disney is to blame here. Not China.
