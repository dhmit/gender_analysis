The best take on it I've seen (and this clearly isn't intended but it's not like Star Wars is too concerned with its subtext and that's fine) is that the Force itself is evil, or at least deeply malignant, but exists nonetheless so the Jedi have to be primarily concerned with policing its use, rather than coming up with ways to use it for good.
