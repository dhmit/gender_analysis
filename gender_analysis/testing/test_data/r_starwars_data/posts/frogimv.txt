If this could have been done cleanly, I think it would have been cool to have all the focus on Rey for TFA, as the “chosen one” or whatever and then midway through TLJ, kill her (oh nos, they killed the last Jedi) and then Finn to have heard force ghost encouraging him to “use the force” spend the second act of that movie discovering his potential— and the TRoS could lead to”skywalker” being a Jedi title, not a name, kind of like in ANH obiwan calls Vader “Darth” as if it’s his first name but we discover that’s a Sith title (I know Lucas changed his mind but it would be a nice symmetry... like poetry. It would rhyme...)
