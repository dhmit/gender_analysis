There was a Star Wars rail shooter-type arcade game where you play through the main battles of the OT, and one of the scenes you go through is in Echo Base, escaping from the invading troopers. In it, there are several Wampas going on a rampage in the base, attacking rebels and imperials alike

(Also you had a couple lightsaber battles which were amazing. A duel against Boba Fett on Tattooine and against Vader on DS2)
