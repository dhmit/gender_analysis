The prequels imply that the jedi can only take you if they get you as a baby, and I think the sith would only want incredibly powerful force-sensitive beings. Maybe there actually are a lot of force sensitive people, but they're not strong enough to be recognized from birth, and it's decided that it's best they never learn to use the force, as they could be more dangerous than valuable, so they're ignored.
