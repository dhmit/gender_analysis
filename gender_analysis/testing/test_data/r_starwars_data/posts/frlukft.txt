I think it'd be perfect if the old man in the beginning of TFA was Kyle Katarn.

Tie in some of the Jedi Academy storyline with Luke's academy and Ben turning. Kyle could say "Luke and I started an academy, but an apprentice of ours turned evil, so Luke and I went into exile and cut ourselves off from the Force. He gave me a clue to find him again."

Then have him put up a badass fight when the First Order attacks the village, and make it more meaningful when Ben kills them all, including Kyle.

They could have also had Jan Ors instead of Holdo in TLJ
