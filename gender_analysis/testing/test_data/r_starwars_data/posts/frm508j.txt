What about "passing the torch" is hard for people to understand? This wasn't the end of Finn's journey. The sequel trilogy was meant to serve as a farewell to Luke, Leia, and Han, and an introduction to Rey, Finn, and Poe. 

This was their first story arc, not their *whole* story. This is Ahsoka in the Clone Wars movie and first season. You don't just RUSH to the end! The journey is what makes it interesting. Watching the characters grow into their roles and find their path IS the story. 

There are going to be more Star Wars movies, and now we have our new leads. Finn will continue his journey in the Force, along with Rey. Acting like Rise of Skywalker was the last time we'll ever see Finn is just ridiculous. 

The whole point of introducing those three characters (well, four. BB-8 counts, too) was to ready us for the next six movies in the ongoing saga that will feature *them.*
