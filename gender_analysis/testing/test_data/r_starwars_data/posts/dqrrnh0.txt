Well, this is the second-most tear-inducing celebrity story I've heard about them meeting a sick child.

The first is from Caroll Spinney, aka Big Bird.  He related a story about a boy who was terminally ill and hadn't smiled in a long time.  Caroll was available to talk to him over the phone and he spoke to him as Big Bird.  Big Bird said something along the lines that they were friends.  The boy asked, "You're my friend?!" "That's right!  I'm your friend!"

The boy then put down the phone, smiled for the first time in months, told his parents that Big Bird was his friend, and then quietly passed away.
