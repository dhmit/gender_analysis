Chirrut Imwe, one of the Guardians of the Whills.  Yeah he seemed to lean towards the Grey Jedi teaching, with his whole “I’m one with the Force; the Force is with me” mantra.  I’m interested to see if they bring in any Grey Jedi philosophy in The Last Jedi.  Hoping maybe Rey or Luke is “The Last Jedi” because he/she becomes a Grey Jedi.
