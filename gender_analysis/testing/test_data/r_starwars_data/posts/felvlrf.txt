On the other hand, there was never a single physical Clone armor ever made for the movies.  Every single one was CGI.  

IDK if there were more practical effects, or more CGI, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a lot of CGI.  Although Phantom Menace I know had considerably less than most people imagine.
