Nope, that is precisely why Windu had a purple lightsaber. He used Vapaad. It was a lightsaber combat technique which used strong emotions during the fight, like anger and passion for swordfighting. Not many could master it because it led many to the dark side (emotions you know) so it was naturally forbidden but Windu was allowed. Also, his purple crystal was a gift from sentient crystalic being during one of his missions.


Edit: I am aware that the reason about purple lightsaber is that Jackson asked for it so he can be seen in the arena, but his color choice was made canon through aforementioned events.
