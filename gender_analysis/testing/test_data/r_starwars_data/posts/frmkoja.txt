Mostly because Disney didn't know what the hell they were doing most of the time.  They gave it to director who didn't understand the source material or an original thought.  Sequel was handled again by someone who didn't understand the drive of the characters.  And finally the guy who didn't understand the source materials once again fucked it up.  The only good Disney movie was Rogue One.  Otherwise the TV work has been good which is run more by the people who actually live and breathe Star Wars.  Daisy Ridley IS a good actress so is Boyega.  But they can't act if the fucking directors can't even give clear motivations for the characters.
