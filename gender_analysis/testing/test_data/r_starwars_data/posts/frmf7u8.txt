> I remeber reading a comic at least a year and a half or two years ago with Luke's ex students becoming the knights of Ren. It was Disney approved so that's the backstory I assumed to be true.

Of course that was the original plan in TFA.  You see the Knights of Ren in one of the flashbacks where Luke's temple is destroyed.  If the Knights of Ren weren't Luke's other students, that would mean the KoR must have been just hanging out there for no reason on the night that Luke sneaked into Kylo's hut and pulled a weapon on him.

Obviously it was changed to try to make Kylo's redemption more believable by throwing in a bunch more external negative influences and creating extenuating circumstances for the murders he was directly responsible for.
