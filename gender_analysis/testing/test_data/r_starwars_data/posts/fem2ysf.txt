Can we please come up with a better name than baby Yoda? That is not Yoda. They call him the asset or the kid during the show. Both of those are better than baby Yoda. The name baby Yoda was started by people who didn’t know that wasn’t Yoda. And yes, it *possible* that could be Yoda, but given the time period the show takes place in this **highly** unlikely.
