Can someone please investigate how exactly, just how, HOW were these movies written. I just don't understand with the amount of material and people willing to, probably even for free, write a captivating script, managed to write, direct, and film such a thoughtless meaningless piece of crap. And I'm not even a huge star wars fan. It's such a disgrace. But I'm sure those disney execs are ecstatic by how much money they made they don't care whether the movies were shit.
