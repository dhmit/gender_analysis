Star Wars fans after TFA: "OMFG this film is too similar to ANH. Do something new!"

Star Wars fans after TLJ: "Fuck Disney. This film took a different direction than previous films. Do something that feels like the previous films!"

Star Wars fans after TROS: "OMFG this film is too similar to ROTJ. Do something new!"

I'm really glad of the fact that the internet fanbase of Star Wars is just a small portion because fuck I couldn't bear it if every viewer was like this.
