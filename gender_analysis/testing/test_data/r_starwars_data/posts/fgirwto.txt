Spot on. I think it's a really funny scene (and I'm not sure you need all three--I think you could drop the first part since the warning sign in itself establishes that there's something dangerous in there and you don't need to establish what exactly it is for the joke to land IMO) but it would throw off the pacing and deflate the tension.

It's funny that so many say they want it in the movie--this is an example of the exact kind thing I'm worried about in terms of the Marvel-ification of Star Wars.
