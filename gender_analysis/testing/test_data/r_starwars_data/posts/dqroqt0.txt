Ford doesn't really HATE Star Wars, he just did a lot to distance himself from it to avoid becoming "Just Han Solo" kind of like how Hamill, Fisher, and to a huge extent Alec Guiness are all very synonymous with their on-screen characters.  So does he hate SW? No.  Did he do a lot to keep his distance? Yes.
