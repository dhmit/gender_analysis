I feel like they gave the side characters a kernel of backstory and then just didn't do anything with them. They're there as clutter,and sometimes even have to compete with other characters for their role. It's messy and disappointing because,some of those things might be interesting to work but the potential was wasted.
At the end they outright replaced him with a "just like you,but more!" Group of characters and then implied he had force powers,but limited to a bit of a contrived moment that seemed like a quick hack to exposite that and to move the plot than an organic moment.
