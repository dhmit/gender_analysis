I dunno, I felt that the relationship still felt hollow even in TCW. It was always that one thing that the show couldn’t fix for me. I know it wasn’t the focus of the show, but as things went on and Anakin was revealed to be more and more of a controlling dick I just couldn’t see why Padme stuck around whenever they were on screen together.
