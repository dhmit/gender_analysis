The flaw with this entire theory is that these are movies about war. It's not "You've Got Mail" in space. Obi-Wan isn't taking a break from chasing Grievous on Utapau because he sees an antique book store that he has to check out. Our characters don't have time to read novels, and if they do, they wouldn't show it on screen. Even on the rare occasions that they show characters doing something leisurely, it will be visual.
