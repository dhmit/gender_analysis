Yeah, before seeing the movie, I figured Finn would have been the main character in the new trilogy and Rey would have been the next Han Solo/ Chewbacca with mechanic skills and Poe be the next Wedge.  But nope, nope, nope........ Burn in hell, J.J. Abrams and your stupid mystery box.  Your mystery box concept fucked the ending of Lost and you fucked up the whole trilogy at the beginning and end!  At least the alternate episode 9 plot that came out after Rise of Skywalker would have made The Last Jedi actually make sense.
