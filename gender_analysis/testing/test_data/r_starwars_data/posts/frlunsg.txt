I hate the new movies. I know hate is a strong word, but the storyline is completely destroyed and  they added too many new characters. I also don't like how it's about 40-50ish years ahead in the time line. I wish Lucas film  ( I believe the company  that produced starwars originally) still made the movies. I like the clone wars more than the real starwars movies.
