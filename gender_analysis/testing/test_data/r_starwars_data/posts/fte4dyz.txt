After I watched episode 8, I honestly felt like Finn should have gotten the heroic death scene because for someone who starts in episode 7 as seeming to be the main character of the new trilogy, by the end of episode 8, he just seems to have faded into the background too much. Of course in episode 9, he's important when he essentially leads the war effort to defeat the Final Order, but I think his character arc would have been so much better if he ended up being the hero to the Resistance in episode 8 and they did something to honor his memory in episode 9. That whole Rose narrative was straight up bullshit and the "not fighting what we hate, saving what we love" thing was just straight up stupid. Like, what else besides killing what you hate has the Resistance been doing all this time?
