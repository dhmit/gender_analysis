I mean we have multiple examples of someone who is not force sensitive wielding a lightsaber. You only need the force to build it, not necessarily wield it. However, there are a number of sabers where the switch was inside it, not on the outside, and you had to maintain concentration on keeping the switch held up with the force to keep the blade active.
