The concept has some legs if we consider him...running away. 

Imagine a mysterious and masked Jedi roaming the outer rim (or beyond) helping people in distress.   

Or Ben hunting down first order remnants while avoiding the rebels trying to take his head for all the crimes he committed.   

I'm sure there's better ideas to be played with here. I just wish they hadn't closed that door completely.
