This would have been awesome and fixed a LOT! so pissed they just kicked Finn and Poe both to the side. 

No reason for it. They could have given them both a fitting end but just didn’t. And don’t even get me started on what they did to Rose.  

I know she was reviled as a character, but the sideline was not even Jar Jar worthy.
