This can happen in literally ANY scifi franchise with faster than light travel: Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate, Battlestar, Halo, Farscape, whatever. In any of them you can ask the question, "well why can't they smash a ship into it really quickly?" Hell you can ask that question in fucking Firefly and they're not even FTL capable because interplanetary speeds in that show are good enough to ruin a planet. 

It isn't a reasonable criticism of the movie. Just enjoy the film and don't worry about it.
