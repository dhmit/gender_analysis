JJ 'sets stuff up' by asking a bunch of questions he has no answers to. He does this consistently, then makes up an answer when he *has* to. It is basically *never* satisfying, and that's because it *can't* be. If the answer to a question isn't true *when it is asked*, then it is not really part of the world. 

So he's great for pulling in attention, setting up mysteries... but not so great on the reveal. And how is anybody *else* meant to continue a story he starts in that way?
