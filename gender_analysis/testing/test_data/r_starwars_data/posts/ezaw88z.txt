Yeah, that book is just an ad company. Fun fact: Guinness Book of World Records takes money from murderous and genocidal dictators to make them appear legitimate on the world stage. Fuck them

Also, they don't own world records, and won't award it if you don't pay them. So many of the records in the book are not the true records.
