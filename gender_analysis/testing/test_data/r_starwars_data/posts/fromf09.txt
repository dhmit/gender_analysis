Rian decided not to use whatever answers JJ provided but still built a consistent sequel with honestly great answers. Who is Rey? Doesn't matter, the Force is universal, be free. What's Luke's deal? The Jedi screwed up his family, so he's done. And Kylo? Luke tried to kill him. See: Jedi, screwed-up family. These are highly effective elements of the film until they're inexplicably abandoned. 

Neat. Good. Now we know what the hell is going on. Inevitable sequels are not an excuse to leave gaping holes in a story. 

JJ didn't build off of that. JJ decided to railroad us back to his original plot... which was *terrible.* Palpatine again? Not even as an invincible force-ghost. Physically revived, but somehow gross and old. Tell me an omnipresent Ian McDiarmid wouldn't be a more intimidating puppeteer. And now Rey's his grand-daughter, because god forbid our protagonist isn't special. 

Spreading 9 across two movies could not have helped. Sudden introduction was not the problem with a rehash of ROTJ and AOTC - quadrupling down on the Death Star lasers while also pulling a secret army out of thin air. Multiple fake-out deaths would be so much worse if they kept happening in two films. Giving people time to think about the macguffin chase could only make it sillier. They need a map in a thing from a guy who's dead but has a knife matching ruins so it's a map to the thing and they don't even get it. But somehow they manage to fly through a rehash of the clouds from Solo, to where a zillion ships rely on *one* radio tower, and their brilliant plan for a wild-west shootout atop a spaceship - with *horses!* - completely fails until two zillion ships fly in to help. They just fly in. Through the secret cloud maze. Which is so un-navigable that it's the only thing keeping the bad guys--

Look.

None of these are great movies.

Imagine reading these scripts as fan-fiction: 

8 is a deconstruction, an anti-war movie in the universe of Star Wars. An invitation for the viewer to dream beyond this one family of space wizards. Turning that into an actual Star Wars movie, unsurprisingly, was kind of weird. 

But 7 is the kind of story written by a fan who thinks the characters are also fans. Where everyone calls the Millennium Falcon by Luke's once-clever reaction to it. Where hologram chess is more surprising than a TV turning on. Where irrelevant props like a deactivated droid and the floaty laser ball get lingering attention, not because a character cares, but because the audience cares. 

And then 9 has to constantly explain what's happening as if the writer never figured out the Q trick. You know how James Bond always gets a gadget that's perfect for some later situation? The writer made up the situation, *then* made up the gadget, then went back and had Q give it to him. The early setup makes the payoff seem clever. The amateur alternative is announcing things right before they matter. It's stimulus/response film-making. Couple that nearsighted plot faucet with everything also being prophecy or conspiracy or fate and you've got anybody's first draft from a screenwriting course. 

You can tell me JJ himself isn't to blame, but the movie without his name on it is the least broken from this trilogy.
