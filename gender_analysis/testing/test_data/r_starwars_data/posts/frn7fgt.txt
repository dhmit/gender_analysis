He was black and....China. >~> Is my best guess for the effed way they handle him. They shrunk him on posters overseas and everything. Last jedi should have ended with Rose callin him on a headset telling him to trust the force or Rey forcechatting him the same. He thenwould force leap up, epic choir music sounds, then lands inside Rose's speeder who starts pulling away while his speeder just barely fails to.male it and gets blasted away along with the doors or succeeds and ruins the super weapon. 


This removes A) Everyone's favorite reason to dislike the Rose character and B) The sidelining effect what they actually did had on the two characters.
