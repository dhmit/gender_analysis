I’m not sure what the existence of a language with glyphs has to do with lack of paper in current-day Star Wars. Clearly they used paper at *some point* if the Jedi texts are any indication. It’s just that they stopped writing in favor of electronic displays which, presumably, must be cheap and/or ubiquitous enough to supplant paper.
