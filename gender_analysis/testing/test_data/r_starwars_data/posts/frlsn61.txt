They were so close to getting that too with those new defector characters helping during the climax. It's like the elements of the theme are there, but they didn't connect the dots to really make that point about Finn leading a rebellion of troopers. They could have added just one scene with Finn and Jannah giving an empassioned speech to a crew of First Order Troopers and getting them to rebel to fight against the Sith Troopers.
