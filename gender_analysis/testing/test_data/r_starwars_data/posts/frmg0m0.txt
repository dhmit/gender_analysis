Ugh... I’m so tired of this narrative. JJ didn’t have a plan. There was nothing to undo. He wrote in some new mystery boxes into a modernized ANH. Rian actually carried the narrative in a way that deliberately created space from the OT (very reverentially) and opened the door for the ST to do anything OTHER than just repeat the OT. The themes and character growth is all very much inline with TFA.
