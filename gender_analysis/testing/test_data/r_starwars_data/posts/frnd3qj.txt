Finn being a Jedi would've been incredible. It would have put a young black actor in the spotlight as a likeable hero. He could have started a storm trooper rebellion and discovered he was force sensitive (the force "awakens" in him). But nah, let's make him a bumbling idiot instead and make him shout "REYYYY and WOOO" all the time. Jesus Christ Disney. They really messed it up in every level.
