His review of TFA is great as well.  I disliked the movie already, and he pointed out so many more flaws I hadnâ€™t fully appreciated.  Just in the beginning scene alone.  Like, why destroy the X-Wing?  Maybe search for the map there?  Why go back to the ship if the map is probably close by?  Just interrogate Poe on the surface.  And it still bothers me that Poe just disappears after the crash, returning to the rebel base, and Finn just happened to grab his jacket so he could walk with it in the middle of a desert just so BB-8 could recognize it later.
